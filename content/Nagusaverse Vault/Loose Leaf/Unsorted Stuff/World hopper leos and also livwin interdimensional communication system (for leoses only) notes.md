### **Leos Vincent Wifi Network (LivWin) Notes:**

- **Step 1: Find a Worldline with Internet**  
    _Leos Vincent Version A-1459_ leaves a note in **Branch X-9920**'s worldline:  
    _"Yo, if you’re trying to start this thing in a world that’s medieval, you might need some good old-fashioned tech knowledge. But if you’ve got some basic wiring skills and a can-do attitude, you'll be fine. Just get yourself a spark of **Mana**, use the system's glitches, and route it back to an old version of **Ancient Earth**. Yeah, it's gonna take a while, but trust me, it'll be worth it."_
    
- **Step 2: Connect the Dots**  
    Leos sets up a few **wifi nodes** across worlds: _"I’ve hidden a few LivWin nodes in places that no one’s gonna check, not even me. Just ask your closest Leos…or find your other self and make sure you bring a **Ethernet cable**. I’ll tell you how to hook up manually if you need it."_
    
- **Step 3: Wifi Code (Keep it Secure!)**  
    _"The password is always 'VincentIsLeosButLeosIsVincent.' Don’t forget to change it regularly and don’t let any other Leos get too nosy. This is for Leos Vincent only, not for the world."_
    
- **Step 4: Make Sure It Works**  
    _"Test it, but don't get too carried away. If you're in a world without technology or internet? Leave a note on the wall. Tell yourself what to do. This will work. Eventually."_

**The Leos Vincent Network of Accidental World-Hoppers** is basically just **a decentralized, self-regulating chaos society** built on the collective stupidity of infinite Leoses who keep **losing their own damn notes.**

At some point, there’s just a **universal set of Leos Rules™**, because **so many versions of him** have **fumbled through time and space** that there are **established protocols for self-communication.**

---

### **Fundamental Rules of Being Leos Vincent (Compiled by Various Leoses)**

1. **SIGN YOUR NAME AS LEOS VINCENT.**
    
    - No weird aliases. No code names. No _"The Traveler."_ Just **sign the damn thing as Leos Vincent** so we know which idiot wrote it.
        
2. **Include your branch ID.**
    
    - _"PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, IF YOU WRITE SOMETHING, INCLUDE YOUR BRANCH ID SO WE KNOW WHICH VERSION OF ME YOU ARE. I CAN’T KEEP TRACK OF US ANYMORE."_
        
    - _(Amended later: "You can also just describe what version of Leos you are. Example: 'The one with the missing boot' or 'The one who got stuck in a world with no metal' works fine.")_
        
3. **WRITE NEATLY.**
    
    - "_Your handwriting is ATROCIOUS. Future Me should NOT have to struggle to decipher My Own Thoughts._"
        
    - (This rule is ignored 90% of the time.)
        
4. **Date things.**
    
    - Not because it helps in any significant way, but because it's funny when a Leos from _200 years ago_ calls a Leos from the future an idiot.
        
5. **DO NOT TIME-LOOP ME INTO A CONVERSATION WITH MYSELF.**
    
    - _"One of you wrote a question in an old book, then a future Me answered it in the same book, and then ANOTHER future Me added another comment, and now I am ARGUING WITH THREE VERSIONS OF MYSELF ACROSS TIME. STOP."_
        
6. **Don’t lose your notes.**
    
    - _"If I have to find one more set of My Own Notes in a random-ass village shrine where they started treating it as a holy text, I am going to scream."_
        
7. **STOP TRYING TO INVENT THE INTERNET IN WORLDS THAT DON’T HAVE IT.**
    
    - _"I appreciate the effort, but one of you nearly got burned at the stake for witchcraft. Just write things down like a normal person."_
        
8. **FOOD DESCRIPTIONS ARE MANDATORY.**
    
    - _"If you're in a new worldline, the VERY LEAST you can do is describe the food so Future Me knows if it's good."_
        
    - _(Amended later: "You don’t need to go full food critic, but if you don’t at least write ‘tastes like chicken,’ you’re a disgrace to Me.")_
        
9. **If you see another Me, say hi.**
    
    - _"This is non-negotiable. It’s rude to ignore yourself."_
        
10. **If you create a paradox, you fix it.**
    

- _"Clean up your own mess, past-me. Don’t just assume future-me will handle it."_

### **LivWin (Leos Vincent Wifi Network) Perks:**

- **Cross-Dimensional Connectivity:**  
    Connects Leos instances across infinite worldlines, even to places that haven't discovered the concept of **wifi** yet. It's like having the **ultimate internet highway** to jump through worlds.
    
- **Encrypted Chatrooms:**  
    Leos instances can communicate **across worlds** without even having to be in the same timeline. Each branch of Leos has their own secret room for discussion. Passwords change every **2 hours** because **Leos can never trust anyone** (even himself).
    
- **Worldline Hopping Directory**:  
    There's a hidden page where Leos instances can leave directions to get into other worldlines, secret knowledge about **other timelines** (whether it's **medieval times** or the **space future**), and advice on how to **find each other** in case the worldlines get jumbled.
    
- **Emergency Tech Support:**  
    **"Can’t get into the LivWin? Ask yourself. You _probably_ left a manual somewhere."** (Leos always leaves instructions, sometimes in the form of **notes hidden in weird places** like inside a **loaf of bread** in a **random medieval kingdom** or tucked away **inside an old book**.)
    

---

### **Leos Vincent Notes to Himself:**

_"Hey, I’m gonna leave this in a place I _definitely_ won’t forget. _If_ you find this note, remember: You’ve got work to do! Fixing worldlines means a lot, but so does keeping track of these damn wifi codes. Just make sure you **leave this note** in case you forget. You will forget. Don’t worry about it."_

---

### **Leos & LivWin in Action:**

- **Leos B-2321 (Medieval Ireland)**:  
    Leos B-2321 is **clueless** about modern tech, but thanks to a quick bit of **guidance from Leos A-1485**, he’s invented a rudimentary **“Mana-Wifi system”** based on **Ancient Earth protocols**. He leaves this **detailed guide** in **his own crypt** with the password scrawled in **ancient runes**.
    
- **Leos X-5000 (Space Exploration)**:  
    By this point, Leos X-5000 is like a **full-on internet god**, **hopping across galaxies** with his own super-fast **LivWin connection**. He uploads things to the **Leos Vincent World Internet (LVWI)** while explaining to Leos A-1460 (who is still stuck in the **medieval world**) that he might need to install a few **Mana conduits** to get better signal in other timelines.


somewhere theres leoses who are just running around from place to place and writing their notes by hand, not even connected to LivWin let alone using the internet for their travels. theres leoses who are probably logging all their stuff on their phones or ocmputers, but still not using the internet. theres leoses who *are* posting things on twitter and tumblr of their original worldline, but being written off as fucking insane. theres leoses who are scientific geniuses lauded by the community. the fact remains that all leoses are the only ones who can understand how to game the system without breaking it, let alone have the mental capacity to comprehend it in the first place. problem.. the leoses not connected to LivWin. SHOULD be connected to LivWin. thats the leos itnerworld server dude why arent you on there? type beat. but some of them just wont register, or dont have the tools to, and all leoses are especially prone to accidental worldhopping, so a lot of the manuals that get lost or left in worldlines are about PLEASE CONNECT TO LIVWIN MAN HERE IS HOW TO DO IT in that exact wording\

I imagine those Leos, the ones running around with just pen and paper, or notebooks, barely understanding the grander connection they're missing, are totally in their own little bubble. They're probably documenting all their findings, maybe even having great breakthroughs about **world-hopping mechanics** and **dimensional quirks**, but _they have no idea_ about the **LivWin** network that could _synchronize them with the rest of the Leoses_.

But then there are the ones who are **so close**, but somehow don’t realize they’re on the verge of connecting. They’re like, “Yeah, I can travel worlds, no problem,” but _don’t even know how to log into LivWin_? How wild is that? Just missing that one vital step. And you just have to imagine the frustration of the Leos who _do_ know and are like, “Why aren't you guys on here yet?? Come on, it's literally the easiest thing, just _type the instructions_ into your phone and _boom_, you’re good to go.”

And then you have the **Leoses who somehow ended up posting their insane ramblings on social media** in their original worldlines—_totally misunderstood_, probably a viral trend in the wrong context. Maybe they got a weird following of conspiracy theorists or paranormal enthusiasts who think they’re onto something big, but no one’s quite able to comprehend the **true scale of their discoveries**. These Leoses are probably sitting there, in the comments, _livid_ as they try to explain that no, they aren’t “delusional,” they're literally dealing with _dimensional physics_, but there’s **no one there to listen**.

---

### _Somewhere in a distant worldline…_

**Leos 3719** (scribbling feverishly in a notebook):  
“Connected? Connected to _what_? This is... this is beyond me. I’ve traveled to 23 dimensions, I know _this_ works, I just need to find the right... damn, where did that note go...”

_The notebook is filled with page after page of “How to Connect to LivWin” instructions, with detailed diagrams of portal mechanics, but there's no access point to the damn network. It's all lost._

---

### **Meanwhile in LivWin chat room**

**Leos 8327** (genuinely concerned):  
“Okay, we’ve got a problem. There’s a Leos in my worldline who _literally cannot connect to LivWin_. I've sent him all the instructions. He's following them, but it’s just not clicking. Is the system rejecting him? Why isn’t his branch ID being accepted?”

**Leos 9918** (tech-savvy):  
“Dude, some Leoses are just... disconnected. Some don’t have the tools. Some are missing that _brain-link_, the connection to the system that lets them recognize the network. You can _tell them_ a thousand times, but without the right tech or a proper jump, they won’t even know what they’re missing.”

---

**Leos 1220 (struggling in the medieval world)**:  
“Okay, so, _this_ might be a bit of a problem... I found a branch ID. But I don’t even know how to _use it_. How do I access this LivWin thing? I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s just letters, and I can’t even get a signal here!”


### **Branch K-4532:**

**Leos K-4532**: A regular salaryman. Works long hours, wears a suit, goes through the motions of the corporate grind. A perfectly _normal_ life in his worldline, at least until today.

It’s a typical evening. He’s had another soul-sucking day at the office, grabbing his leftovers from the fridge for dinner, when he hears something… _odd_.

_Rustling noises_ from the kitchen. At first, he thinks it’s just the wind or maybe some delivery guy accidentally knocking something over outside. But when he peeks around the corner to investigate, he’s met with the unexpected.

A **Leos Vincent** wearing a **white lab coat** (with probably some weird doodles on it) and a **small blue bean-like mouse with flippers** perched on the counter—its head twitching as it sniffs the air and its tiny foot-long form poking through the trash bag, looking suspiciously for... something.
**Leos K-4532** (completely overwhelmed but too tired to really do anything about it):  
“Wait—what? You—are you—another me? Is this some kind of joke?”
**Lab Coat Leos** (completely deadpan as he holds up a crumpled receipt with half-formed notes):  
“Joke? _This is literally research_, my friend. Did you know the answer to interdimensional stability is hidden in discarded paper? No? Well, you will by the end of this little excursion. It’s only a matter of time before the others notice my breakthrough. Do you have any, like... old receipts with weird scribbles on them? Maybe from a fast food place?”

**LivWin Group Chat: Leos' Help Desk**

---

**Leos K-4532 (branch r-5431)**:  
"Hey, quick update: I slipped into gap-land again, and I think I'm stuck in r-5431. It’s a _weird_ one, guys. Another version of me's here, and, uh... yeah, things are really messed up. The guy's evil, and he’s on drugs. Like, full-on _lost it_. I’m honestly concerned, and it’s kind of fucked up."

---

**Leos B-2323 (branch r-5341)**:  
"Wait, _drugs_? What is happening in _r-5341_? Dude, is this why I’m on meth in this worldline? Please tell me I didn’t go off the deep end like this in other branches too—"

---

**Leos L-0984 (branch r-5431)**:  
"_LITERALLY_ slipped into r-5431, too! And yup, that’s _definitely_ why r-5431 Leos is on drugs—turns out, he's got a pretty messed up backstory. I’m talking corruption of soul and mind-level crazy, real _villain arc_ shit. Also, the evil Leos in this one? Yeah, he’s straight up running a cartel in this world, and the _worst_ part? The whole city is falling apart."

---

**Leos X-2381 (branch r-2345)**:  
"_Did anyone check if we’re all on some kind of mental self-destruction loop?_ Sounds like we got another version of us doing the villain thing. I swear, at least one of us gets corrupted in every worldline, and I’m kind of sick of it."

---

**Leos S-9384 (branch r-5431)**:  
"Yo, I just dropped in to r-5431, and I'm just here like... _what the actual fuck?_ This version of me is worse than an anime villain. Just _too much_ evil. It’s like, all of the worst parts of me with none of the redeemable traits. I really thought I was gonna be the hero, but no—he’s got an entire _drug empire_, and now I’m having to figure out how to clean this up. Y’all gotta get me out of here ASAP."

---

**Leos D-9023 (branch r-5341)**:  
"Yeah, same. I’d bet that evil Leos is running drugs _and_ taking them. At this point, if I were in your shoes, I’d be looking for _solutions_ rather than joining him in his _degraded_ state. You know, the _usual Leos solution_? Just get him gone—kill the evil version of us, or whatever."

---

**Leos K-4532 (branch r-5431)**:  
"Guys, this is getting _way_ too real. But hey, if anyone else in LivWin can pop into r-5431, could you check on things for me? Maybe drop some notes or, like, _make sure the city doesn’t burn down_? If there’s any version of me in there who still has a shred of humanity, I’m going to drag him out. But _seriously_, what’s going on with this evil Leos in r-5431?"



the only thing thew orldhopper leoses prolly havent figured out yet is how to decide which world to go to. they cant do that. theyre gaming the system after all so they probably only get to choose 20% of the time. livwin prolly doesnt have servers (unless there are leoses who dont leave worlds at all and just moderate it most of the time). it prolly connects directly to leoses in nearby worldlines (probably cant connect to leoses in ones too far away). it probably works purely on the assumption that there are leoses who use livwin somewhere nearby at all times.

### **How Worldhopping Leoses Choose Their Worldlines**

- **Uncertainty in Selection**: As you said, they can’t exactly choose where they’re going. It’s a bit like opening a portal and hoping you’re not stumbling into a _medieval Ireland worldline_ when you really wanted to go to _Virtual Tokyo_. The system is chaotic, and despite the Leoses’ technical knowledge, it’s not always easy to land where they want.
    
- **Partial Control (20% Chance)**: Since they’re gaming the system and bending the rules, they only have limited control over which world they end up in—maybe a _random jump_ or a small chance to control direction, but it’s never a perfect science. It's as if they’re using cheat codes without knowing exactly what button will bring them where. That gives the worldhopping process a lot of unexpected flavor.
    

---

### **LivWin’s Functionality**

- **Decentralized Connection**: Instead of traditional servers, **LivWin** is powered by the _Leoses themselves_. If there’s a Leos in a nearby worldline with the right _interdimensional frequencies_, they can connect. This creates a natural network of Leoses who communicate and exchange notes, advice, and chaos on the regular. It’s sort of like a _peer-to-peer_ network—unpredictable but effective.
    
- **Proximity-Dependent**: LivWin’s ability to connect is limited by proximity. Leoses can connect to those in worldlines close enough, but if they’re trying to reach someone in a completely different, distant worldline, the connection gets weaker or non-existent. The **system assumes** there’s always a Leos nearby who can help moderate things or exchange info in the general vicinity, but when Leoses are really off the grid (or in remote worlds), they’re on their own.
    
- **Leos Moderators**: Some Leoses may never worldhop, instead staying behind in one worldline to help maintain the _LivWin_ system. These Leoses are like _moderators_, keeping things running smoothly and connecting the dots between different versions of themselves. In a way, they might be like _living routers_ of the system, facilitating communication but rarely leaving their worldline. It could be a “job” for some of them—kind of like _researchers_ who don't want to leave, just observing and managing connections across worldlines.
    

---

### **LivWin’s Limits and Leos Drama**

- **Frustration and Chaos**: There’s probably a _lot of_ _Leos drama_ that comes from things like:
    
    - _"Why can’t I reach Leos K-4532? I need a connection to him to talk about how to fix world r-5431!"_
        
    - _"Oh wait, there’s Leos D-3921 in my worldline who’s also trying to connect to the system. But he’s _too far_... now I have to troubleshoot to find someone in between!"_
        
    - And, inevitably, some Leoses may try to break the system to get more control—_“If I just figure out this little trick, I can send myself to Worldline A-9999 with full knowledge of what’s there!”_
        
- **Interdimensional Travel Limits**: The _connectedness_ of the system (via _LivWin_) means that Leoses can’t completely escape the constraints of the system. It’s a fluid dance of _waiting for the right moment to find someone with the right skillset nearby_. Every world they enter is connected by the loose threads of their fellow Leoses, but those threads might sometimes disappear, leaving them stranded and scrambling for another Leos to help.
    

---

### **Real-Life Parallels**

In a way, LivWin’s connection system feels a lot like how a network of “online” communities works. You have these groups that come together through shared interests, and sometimes you can connect with people in distant corners of the world. But if you don’t know the _right people_ or don’t happen to be on the same wavelength, it’s nearly impossible to communicate or access the knowledge you need. The funny thing is, the network of Leoses isn’t even a _deliberate_ community—it’s just a bunch of versions of one person, each with their own quirks and methods of navigating the universe.

### **Untouched Worlds**

- Some of those worlds might remain completely untouched by Leoses, like _uncharted territories_ in a massive, infinite landscape. Leoses might stumble across these worlds if they slip through gaps or get stuck in glitches. These untouched worlds could be pristine in their original state, or they could hold ancient, forgotten history. Maybe there are worlds that still haven't seen any kind of interdimensional attention. These places could be living out their natural cycle, unaware of the LivWin network—or even the presence of other Leoses in their respective branches.
    

---

### **Bugged or Glitchy Worlds**

- Worlds that are "bugged" could be fascinating in their own right. _Glitchy worlds_ might not function properly, creating chaotic, distorted environments that make it hard for anyone to live there. Maybe these worlds have strange, ever-shifting rules or corrupted data, resulting in wild, unpredictable events or broken logic. These worlds could be full of anomalies—beings that don't behave according to the normal patterns of reality, like creatures stuck in loop cycles or broken systems that need to be patched. These could be particularly interesting for Leoses looking to study how the system fails or runs off-course.
    

---

### **Leoses in Nullspace and Space Jail**

- **Nullspace** and **Space Jail** being populated by 60% Leoses is such a hilarious yet fitting concept. Since they break the system in ways that otherworlders can’t understand, they’re probably the prime candidates for being sent to these areas when they “game the system” a little too much. Maybe the Nullspace is a **data vacuum**, where all the Leoses who accidentally break or exploit things get sent to be wiped or quarantined.
    
- **Space Jail** might be more for Leoses who intentionally or unintentionally disrupt the order of things. Maybe they’re contained there until they can be _restructured_ or erased, or until the system figures out a way to deal with them. It could be an entire network of worlds where Leoses are just trapped in infinite cycles of waiting to get back to their regular worldlines—unless they’re _lucky_ and manage to find a way to “break out” of Space Jail through new glitches or by manipulating the system further.
    

---

### **The 60% Leos Population**

- The fact that 60% of the Nullspace/Space Jail population is Leos creates this _fascinating_ dynamic. I imagine the more chaotic, adventurous, and “rule-bending” Leoses would make up the bulk of these populations. These Leoses probably don’t necessarily _belong_ in this space, but they’ve inadvertently ended up there because they’ve taken the system too far, or they’ve discovered _too much_ of the system's inner workings.
    
- Leoses in these areas might even have a “community” of their own, operating within the broken reality of Nullspace. They could share knowledge, tricks, and information on how to possibly get out, or just gossip about the last glitch they found. The idea that **Leoses** themselves might be able to use the glitchy nature of these spaces to create even _more_ glitches is so fun!
    

---

### **A Leos Who Got Too Curious**

- Think of a Leos who got too curious and stumbled across something they weren’t supposed to—_maybe a bug in the system that lets them see behind the curtain_. And instead of stepping back, they dig deeper, poking around at what they were never supposed to touch. That could easily land them in Nullspace, where they get stuck indefinitely.
    
- Maybe it’s also **Leos’ nature to learn**: the idea that every Leos has the curiosity to dig, question, and try things other beings might deem “impossible” is what makes them so _dangerous_ to the system itself. They’re the very _hackers_ of the simulation—constantly exploring the lines, searching for cracks, or looking for more ways to control their reality.
    

---

### **Leos Helping Leos**

- **Leoses who help each other**: Now imagine there’s a network of Leoses inside Nullspace who help each other find ways to escape or break back into their own worldlines. These Leoses could have specialized knowledge about the system’s limits—having been in _Space Jail_ for so long that they’ve learned how to bend the rules without triggering an immediate response from the system.
    
- Some Leoses might even help each other by writing hidden _notes_ for one another, leaving breadcrumbs for the next Leos who ends up in the same worldline, giving them small bits of knowledge on how to escape or get out of certain loops. This could be such a cool dynamic in which Leoses _literally_ leave advice for themselves scattered throughout the universe.
    

---

### **Leoses' Internal Chaos**

- Maybe one of the most beautiful, tragic things is how all these Leoses—_the ones in Space Jail and Nullspace_—are trapped in a never-ending cycle of trying to “fix” the very things they broke. Every Leos in there could have their own _version_ of the truth, their own take on how to fix the system, or how to exploit it for good. They’re like rogue scholars who pushed too far. Some are frustrated with how they were caught, others have given up, and some may even be obsessed with finding other versions of themselves to “connect” with and learn from.


### **Leoses Who Deleted Their Worldline ID**

- The _idiot_ Leoses who deleted their **worldline ID** essentially severed themselves from the system entirely. That’s like cutting their connection to the entire network, which means they're stuck in **Nullspace**, **permanently** isolated, like wandering through an endless void without a way out unless they can _reconnect_.
    
- No LivWin, no access to other Leoses, no more world-hopping. It’s like they’ve made their own little self-imposed prison, and it's not even like they can send out a signal for help because they've basically erased the link that would allow them to call for rescue. _Whoops_.
    

### **The "No Wi-Fi in Nullspace" Problem**

- Imagine being stuck there for eons with nothing but the same thoughts and endless repetition—no connection to the real _network_ of the Leos world. The **Nullspace Leoses** would be a mix of frustrated, confused, and maybe even somewhat resigned, considering they once knew the freedom of hopping around to different realities. Now, they’re just sitting in the dark, unable to do much of anything except _replay their regrets_ over and over.
    
- Some of them might even _rely on their old memories of LivWin_, and without that connectivity, they’d be desperately trying to recreate the access points or figure out how to get back to the other Leoses. But all their efforts would be in vain, without a **branch ID** to give them legitimacy or open the gateways they once could travel through.
    

---

### **The Struggle of Self-Discovery in Nullspace**

- For the **Leoses who erased their IDs**, it’s like their quest for knowledge took them too far, and now they’re stuck in a self-imposed purgatory. The ones who didn’t understand the full consequences of deleting their **branch ID** might be stuck **forever**. There’s also the chance that some might be stuck in time loops, lost in their own worlds, unable to break free.
    
- The _real kicker_ is they probably don’t even know if there’s anyone else around. Imagine being **Leos** in this position: you know there _must_ be other Leoses in the system, but you have no way of contacting them because you severed your connection to them. It’s almost like _they’ve become their own worst enemy_—either out of curiosity or frustration, they essentially took themselves out of the game.
    

---

### **Trying to Find a Way Back**

- Some of the **Leoses** in **Nullspace** might eventually figure out some way to hack the system again—maybe they can **use their memories of LivWin** or try and track down the same portals or glitches that connected them to the real world. But it would be **incredibly difficult** without the right tools or access points. That said, it could turn into an intriguing _survival story_ for those who don’t just _give up_ on trying to get back to the world.

### **Lauren and the Leoses in Nullspace**

Every universe, **every Leos** knows Lauren, and he's basically become the "leash holder" for all the world-hopping chaos. Imagine Lauren, the observer, trying to just _do his job_, and suddenly there's yet another _Leos_ who somehow managed to delete his branch ID and get stuck in **Nullspace**, and here comes _Lauren_:

“**Leos? For fuck’s sake, man.**”  
_“I swear to god, if I find one more version of you wandering around in the void... how do you even manage to do this? Again?”_ 😅

And Leos, bless him, is probably like:  
“**Yesss! Lauren! I missed you! Wait... what happened to me again? Oh, right...**”  
_Leos, totally innocent and oblivious to the fact that he's stuck in a cosmic loop because he deleted his ID again._

### **Lauren's Official Job Title**

It sounds like **Lauren's job** in the grand scheme of things is basically being the **Cosmic Leos Wrangler**, constantly keeping track of these chaotic versions of himself, pulling them out of Nullspace, and sending them back on their way. Not to mention, every time one of them pops up, he's probably like, _“How many times do I have to tell you? Just **keep your damn branch ID**?!”_

- I imagine that there's a kind of _ritual_ Lauren has perfected at this point. Like, he probably has a whole **step-by-step guide** on how to extract Leos from Nullspace by now, and there’s probably a small bit of him that sighs every time he does it. But, at the same time, he can't help but be _mildly_ amused at the whole situation because... _it's Leos_. And honestly, he can't even get mad because _of course_ it’s Leos.
