#Voltaction #Story


The summer house-
Was a manor. The sort with a gabled roof and red-runner carpet. Nestled ten meters from the treeline, where the grass hits upon a wall- clay bricks stacked twenty-five rows high, weathered by age.
Finger-sized gaps where the air pocketed mortar like a pin to a bubble. A little sticky, smelling like heat under sun that burned a bit too hot mid-season.
Finger-sized gaps- ill-fit for climbing holds. Provided those fingers belonged to an adult, not to hands half as big. Belonging to a boy far too inquisitive and even more obtuse to the purpose of a wall.
Gap-toothed and grinning, even when his thumb grazes and peels some skin. Twenty-five bricks underfoot in a flash, for the practiced hands of the child thief-prodigy. Small, so sure of himself. Palms blistered and cheeks dirt-smeared, carrying twigs in the frayed ends of purple hair. Wearing a smile that thought he was some kind of hero.
The summer house-
Was a playpen, really. Walls papered nice, floors polished clean. One room too large with a desk too tall and a chair too hard. Well-lit, through windows twice as tall as any child. A closet-free-standing, wooden, on legs. No television here. Downstairs, maybe. But it's only a holiday home. A temporary safehouse for the son of a lineage with too many enemies.
He'll be moved soon, but not yet.
For now, action figures lay scattered over the rug. Pretty red fresh from the toy store somewhere in town. Abandoned. As sleek and beautiful the paint, as cool and regal the sharp turn of their joints- useless with nobody to share them with. Waiting, for the next time two sets of hands gather them into arms, throw them out the window to clamber down the gutter pipe and secret away into the forest.
The summer house-
Became a castle, sometimes. A spaceship in others. A secret base, a crime scene. Whatever they needed it to be. The red carpet turned rivers of lava, when the servants were away from the night. The guards, the dragons that lurked in the magma. The desk upstairs was a sentry tower. The garden hose, a live wire, and the hedge trimmers cursed objects- sharp and dangerous.
Hibari didn't argue, but he laughed. He liked the way Kanato pronounced it true. With fake-seriousness and one raised brow like a little king of make-believe.
They made rules. Broke them often.
Rule one: Don't go past the third tree without me! Never without backup.
Rule two: If you fall, do it fun-like. Preferably arms splayed, theatrical spiel and all.
Rule three: If I cry, you gotta swear never to tell. No matter what.
Rule four: We're tough, right? We should act like it! Blood was acceptable. Bruises were currency. Tears were private.
Hibari stole one of the shirts from Kanato's father's closet and wore it like armor, even though it sagged past his knees. Kanato retaliated by tearing the socks from Hibari's feet- both of course, always both-and turned them into hand puppets that flirted with each other outrageously.
Wrestling like puppies, all knees and mud and bony limbs still growing, until the world spun out on the sound of high laughter.
Shaken hands three times. Swapped snacks once. Made a blood pact with a prick of the thumb and freakish panic the moment the wild boy Hibari bled too much. Preciously sheltered Kanato cried- he never admits it, now- and Hibari dashed a dandelion across his cheek like a war stripe and said,
"Don't worry. Now you've got magic protection."
The summer house-
Was one vertical slat, in the gap of Kanato's closet door. One vertical slat.
Lights off, but dimly lit by the moon. Faded silhouettes of the desk and bed and abandoned action figures lain soft against the static of the dark.
Kanato had one eye slammed shut, the ball of Kanato's tiny wrist pressed over the lid to stop the light of the trembling reticle leaking. People shouting his name-
"Where's the boy?"
"Please, get Kanato quickly!"
- but Hibari held him fast, one arm wrapped around his middle. Other hand over his mouth, squashing any cries back down his throat. Wedged between his teeth, sides of fingers catching tears in globules.
"Don't cry-"
A muffled thud downstairs. The rat-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta of something dangerous-
Kanato whimpered something between his teeth-
"They'll hear you-
"Where's Kanato, find him, quickly-"
The hinges screeching, unclean, forced open. Footsteps. Hibari's grip tightened.
He was shaking, too.
The summer house-
The summer house-
One vertical slat, slashed through by a spray of red.
The summer house isn't quite red anymore.
More copper now. Rust. Blood splatter turned dark, sprayed across the walls in ghastly streaks. Crusted in the gaps between floorboards. Mould living in corners with the spiders.
Hibari crouches, sweeping his tie over his shoulder. Twice as tall as he was, then, plucking up one lone bullet from where it pinged off the stair-rail and lodged near the base of the wall. Nine-millimeter cartridge.
Ten years old.
"We don't have to go far for clues, do we?" mutters Hibari.
Behind him Kanato rights his lapels, dodging a stain where a body might've been.
"There's a reason they haven't demolished it yet," he says. He turns his nose up at the dust caked on the boarded-up window sills. "Not that they're going to pick up the case... do you think it's haunted?"
Hibari laughs.
"No bodies. If they're haunting, it's not here." He stands in one languid movement, turning the bullet between thumb and forefinger. Ten years old. "Scared?"
"No," he replies. Not anymore. "Nothing here but the work of people. Forget ghosts."
"No zombies in the garden, then."
Overgrown, now. Grass as tall as thigh. The brick wall is now only five meters from the treeline, pockets in mortar now home to devil's ivy.
Kanato snorts, dry.
"Better not be."
Hibari grins. A smile that still thinks he's some sort of hero, even now. Maybe a sharper where his adult teeth have grown into canines. A smile borrowed from someone else's childhood, still embedded in his bones.
Even if this place is just a crypt.
