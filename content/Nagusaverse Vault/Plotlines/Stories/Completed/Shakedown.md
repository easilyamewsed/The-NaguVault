###### [[Watarai Hibari#Homemade|Watarai Hibari]]
- From a family of phantom thieves, he was sold into the yakuza to pay off accumulated debts.
- His love for his family prevents him from leaving unauthorised, so he seeks to repay the exorbitant amount and obtain his freedom.
- He uses his thief skills to steal from the rich and turn in their treasures at pawn shops.
- But the amount keeps climbing, and though unjust, Hibari has remained for several years for his family's sake.
- He does not give in to hopelessness however, no matter what the Oyabun makes him do.
