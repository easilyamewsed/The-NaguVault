###### [[Fura Kanato#Alternate Canons|Fura Kanato]]
- The ruthless heir to the mafia.
- This Kanato was raised on manipulation, power, and bloodshed.
- His loveless life was filled with violence, and he has come to seize the things he wants with selfishness and ego.
- His worth is dictated by strength, and the ability to take.
- This man does not entirely understand love, but yearns for it all the same.
- He is possessive and acts as if always starving for something.
- His envy of others is ugly and limitless.
- He enjoys the suffering of those he deems luckier than himself--that is to say, nearly everyone.
- Underneath, his ego is fragile. He is unstable, and is difficult to reason with if you step on his emotional landmines.
- The only end for him is death.

**Relationship with Seraph**
- Seraph is a hovering shadow. Kanato sees him as perfunctory and annoying.
- Rather than finding Seraph's inability to think for himself cute, he sees it as stupid and foolish.
- However, Seraph's strength cannot be denied. Even if the fact he follows mission impetus above all else is unsightly.
- Seraph is boring. If Kanato wants to 'play' somewhere, he will do everything in his power to lose him.
- Even if he wouldn't ask for anything from Seraph--for matter of looking weak or otherwise--he would trust Seraph with anything. If only because they share a mutual understanding of each other.
- Their worldviews are similar.

###### [[Seraph Dazzlegarden#Alternate Canons|Seraph Dazzlegarden]]
- An assassin since childhood, overtaken by the cruelty of his trade.
- While he hasn't abandoned the last of his humanity, he nulls it as weakness, and turns his blade on all including himself.
- He thinks little of and for himself, and is an attack dog by nature.
- His hopelessness has surpassed despair and become lifestyle. His fighting style is, though clean, rash if prolonged.
- Ironically, this numbness has made him a monster that is hard to rattle. But he may crumble if he recognises genuine kindness.
- It's possible such sentiments are so beautiful to him they are ugly. He may not know what to do in the face of it.
- Sympathy may cause him to lash out like a wild animal.
- The only end for him is death.

**Relationship with Kanato**
- Kanato is his charge. Protect at all costs. Cannot lose him.
- In some ways, he doesn't know what to do without Kanato. When he is alone, he is often thinking of where the hell Kanato is.
- His loyalty, though not unshakeable, is strong. It lies with the mission before Kanato, however.
- There is no solace to be found in Kanato, but Seraph respects him for his--albeit cynical--wisdom and prudence.
- Kanato is a troublemaker. If Seraph doesn't keep a tight leash on him, someone will get hurt. Whether that be Kanato, Kanato's victims, or Seraph himself.
- Without Kanato's sarcastic wit and trust in him, Seraph would be emotionally worse off.
