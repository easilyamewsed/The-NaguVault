##### Characterisation

###### [[Fura Kanato#Alternate Canons|Fura Kanato]]
- Though not unloved, this Kanato grew up entirely in the hands of his father's mafia. He did not meet Hibari early enough to understand freedom and kindness, if at all.
- He is neither a cold nor expressive fellow. In fact, he comes across as conversational and amicable, if not a little low-tension or muted in bad moods.
- He enjoys having fun and making games of things--but his idea of doing so often involves messing, teasing, or threatening others in ominous ways. Negotiations with him are rollercoasters.
- Though sharper and more ruthless, he stands by a strict moral code and finds value in his work. He sees himself and the mafia as a necessary evil.
- There may be aspects of kindness in his belief, related to brotherhood and belonging.
- Even so, a small part of him will never truly give in to the idea he belongs with the mafia. This is the kindness in Kanato he cannot bring himself to kill.
- Stripped of a social childhood and born with responsibility, deep down, Kanato may yearn for trivial things. Trivial things, that would mean the world to him.
- He trusts nobody. Measures others by effort, and is forced into the mold of his authority even while defying it.
- He is secretive. Nobody is likely to know anything of his true feelings, complaints, or wishes.
- Due to his heritage, his network exceeds that of any other criminal organisation. His mafia is the backbone of underworld activity; a criminal empire with connections that span from Italy to Japan.
- He has a hand in every underworld trade, in one way or another. And every single one is justified by some moral ambiguity.
- Even so, he is a hero to his followers. He commands through respect, authority, and understanding before power and fear. All of them nonetheless.
- To the townsfolk, he is both myth and necessary. Without Kanato's protection and other services to fill in the gaps law enforcement leaves, many civilians would be hurt or suffering.
- To the police, he's untouchable. His outward face is that of a successful businessman, with the evidence to back it up. His prudence and diligence means he cannot be tied to his crimes.
- Ironically, this variant of Kanato is the most altruistic, even if he sees himself as the paragon of egotistical scum.
- He calls it survival. He cannot bring himself to hate himself for what he is, not truly. 'This is just how his life is, and who I have to be.'
- Make no mistake. Cross him, and you will be met with a sure end.

**Relationship with Watarai Hibari**

*In mafia-shanti worldlines:*

- His right hand, and the [[Watarai Hibari#Alternate Canons|drug lord]] of [[Chinatown]].
- Theirs is a business relationship, before all else. But Kanato's curiosity in Hibari's motivations will feed it into growing.
- To Kanato, Hibari is a mystery. He cannot understand why such a free-spirited and talented person would stay in the underworld.
- With his origins clouded, Kanato is convinced Hibari could run away whenever he chooses. Kanato would let him go, if he wished it.
- But he remains perplexed by Hibari's dogged loyalty. There are times where Hibari is even a pest.
- Hibari's constant persuasions, proposals, and pestering may eventually chip away at Kanato's facade.
- He may be the only one capable of seeing the tired, burdened young boy underneath.
- As such, Hibari is someone Kanato watches with interest, apprehension, and reluctant wonder.
- He does not know how fragile this man is, if at all. But if Hibari is going to see his weaknesses, he must be protected and attended to properly.

*In mafia-main worldlines:*
- [[Watarai Hibari|A cheerful young man that runs a caf√©.]]
- His warmth and energy is refreshing, but his social and emotional acuity is unnerving.
- Kanato must tread carefully.
- Even if his presence feels like a comfort.

*In the [[Shakedown]] worldline:*
- An intriguing young man who came along with some upstart yakuza pig.
- A familiar young man, at that, who Kanato vaguely recognises.
- And a daring one, too, for breaking into the villa of a mafia boss' son (twice over?).
- Interesting. He wants to play.

</br>

*In the mafia-idol worldline:*
- Oshi. Nobody can know.

**Relationship with Shikinagi Akira**
</br>
</br>
- A business associate, and source of information.
- He inherited this connection from his father, just as Akira did.
- In exchange for protection, compensation, and whatever else, Akira acts Kanato's window into almost all underground affairs.
- As Akira's network is unmatched, Kanato makes extra efforts to maintain relations. Overtime, they have grown to become something close to friends.
- Having developed an understanding of one another, it may be difficult to sway them should an attempt ever occur.

` `
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
- [[Shikinagi Akira|A minor annoyance whose own goals]] get in the way of Kanato's business sometimes.
- He marks it as survival, and admires Shikinagi's determination and goals, although he thinks of Shikinagi as short-sighted.
- In the end, he has no reason to meddle with Shikinagi's affairs as long as he's not in the way of things.
</br>
</br>
- One of Kanato's personal attendants, 'borrowed' from a family of spies through a connection he inherited from his father.
- A competent person, if not a little naggy.
- Often acts as Kanato's accountant, or keeper of affairs.

**Relationship with Seraph Dazzlegarden**
</br>
</br>
- A business associate, and Akira's personal bodyguard.
- Seraph is a weapons broker. In exchange for the security of warehouses provided by Kanato's grasp on port activities, Seraph trades him items and other things, and often tests arms for him.
- He doesn't understand much about Seraph Dazzlegarden. He doesn't need to.
- As Akira's primary companion, there's no reason to interfere and meddle in Seraph's past affairs.
- He's somewhat intimidating in person, though. A bit naive, but overall a nice guy.
- Both are taciturn once the discussion is over.
- There's no reason to interact beyond cursory greetings and business. 
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
- [[Seraph Dazzlegarden|Guy who hangs out with Shikinagi, who was a pest once.]]
- If he knew anything about Seraph's past, it's no longer relevant.
- Perhaps admires or respects Seraph a little, for being able to break out of his cage.
</br>
</br>
</br>
- One of Kanato's personal attendants, 'borrowed' from a family of assassins through a connection he inherited from his father.
- Seeing his true feelings, Kanato doesn't give Seraph killing orders often. Or, he provides Seraph with enough justification not to feel bad, which is a step up from his prior employers.
- His time with Shikinagi and Kanato has loosened him up and made him almost cute, like a little brother.
- Most often acts as Kanato's courier.
