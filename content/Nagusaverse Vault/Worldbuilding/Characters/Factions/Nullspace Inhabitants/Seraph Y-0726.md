##### Background
###### Branch Life
- Normal.

###### Post-Branch Life
- Due to some form of glitch, Seraph survived the destruction of Y-0726. However, his data was corrupted, and the worldline was unable to reset due to his presence.
- He was pulled into [[Nullspace]] by [[Lauren C-0079|Lauren-kami]], where he now exists in a fragmented state of himself.
- Sometimes he follows around the various Hibaris and Kanatos that inhabit Nullspace.
- He seems to call for Akira every now and then, but is otherwise silent.
