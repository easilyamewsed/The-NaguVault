**Lauren Iroas (C-0079)**
*a.k.a: Kamippoi Lauren, Nun Lauren, Lauren-kami, First Observer-senpai*
- A version of [[Lauren Iroas]] who lives in [[Nullspace]], where he operates as the *First Observer*, an entity responsible for removing, relocating or reinserting anomalous beings in worldlines.

---
##### Background
###### Branch C-0079: Pre-Nullspace Life
- Lauren worked as an [[EDEN|E.D.E.N]] enforcer and police officer.
- His personal motivation was to restore order after the repeated demon attacks were tearing up the city.
- As an [[EDEN|E.D.E.N]] enforcer, he was responsible for the protection of citizens from hostile demons, and a personal friend and bodyguard of the man with the last soulbond in the world.

###### Post-Branch Life: Nullspace
- During the destruction of [[C-0079|Branch C-0079]] brought about by [[Kanae]] and [[Kuzuha]], Lauren Iroas slipped through a [[Virtual Universe#Dimensional Gaps|dimensional gap]], avoiding erasure but becoming stranded in [[Nullspace]].
- His worldline was not just destroyed, but thoroughly obliterated and deleted from the system entirely.
- Unlike most entities who fall into Nullspace, Lauren is not fully disconnected from the system. His [[Branches#Branch ID|branch ID]] still exists, though his worldline does not.
	- This glitched state means the system cannot delete, relocate or reincarnate him.
	- As a result, he can still access system functions.

- While wandering Nullspace, Lauren encountered an alternate version of [[Leos Vincent]], who was [[World-Hoppers|world-hopping]] and had become trapped after deleting his branch ID.
- From Leos, he learned how to manipulate the system using Nullspace as a loophole.
- Through trial and error, Lauren discovered he could extract, relocate or return entities within worldlines, effectively bypassing the system's standard death processes.
- He made it his job to pull out anomalous persons from collapsing or collapsed worldlines, allowing the system to cleanly reset the worldline. 
	1. *World-Ending Anomalies*
	   - People whose actions lead to systemic failure, whether through overriding fate, chasing an unattainable goal or wish that is so powerful it confuses the system, or pushing a worldline into instability.
	   - Normally, these individuals don't intend to destroy worlds, but their existence alone is disruptive enough.
	2. *Glitched Entities from Dead Worlds*
	   - People left behind in a worldline that no longer exists, who were meant to die or be erased.
	   - Since a worldline cannot hard reset if even one person remains, Lauren removes these trapped souls so the world can reset cleanly.
	3. *Lost or Displaced Entities*
	   - People who accidentally fell into Nullspace, got caught in a systemic loophole, or were forcibly removed by another anomaly.
	   - These people can be returned to their proper worldline if its still intact.
	   - Usually, these people are [[World-Hoppers|World-hopping Leos Vincents]] who stupidly deleted their own [[Branches#Branch ID|branch IDs]] like idiots, but this is not always the case.
