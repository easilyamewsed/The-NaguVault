- Athleticism is maxxed out. Although his stamina isn't very good. He only puts on muscle if he really tries (truth: doesn't put on muscle), and his flexibility is awful.
- Excellent dexterity; is naturally good at sleight of hand, and authenticity/jewel appraisal.
- Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering; including casing mission sites for optimal entry and exit points, stealing blueprints and access keys for their mission sites ahead of time, infiltration, lockpicking, forgery, and preparing disguises.

- It seems like he's from somewhere in Tohoku, even though his speech pattern is just pieces of random dialects.

#### Background
###### General 
- The heir to a family of phantom thieves and member of [[Voltaction]]. 
- [[Fura Kanato]]'s partner.
- He's abandoned stealing wants to 'steal people's hearts instead'.
- He moved from the country, and now works at [[Café Zeffiro]] and describes himself as a freeter.
	- Although his recent busyness means he's rarely given shifts at the café anymore.
- His relationship with his family seems to be largely amicable.
- `But if so, why did he have to run away to go to high school in the city?`
###### High school 
- He ran away from home because the country didn't provide him with the means to 'perform' or become 'a phantom thief of justice'.
- Forged his application to get into [[Erfolg College]], the boarding school where he met the rest of Voltaction.
	- It seems he doesn't remember Kanato from his childhood, so he believes this is where he met Kanato as well.
	- His grades were awful, but he got by on helpfulness, enthusiasm, and athletic-based merit points.
	- Was a member of the baseball club, and captain at one point.
	- Without Kanato, he would never have made it past first grade. 

###### Headcanons
- I assume he abandoned his position as their heir, since he doesn't use his family's crest.
- This could be interpreted as a childhood where he was often ignored and/or unattended, which would lead into his extroverted and friendly attitude. For story purposes.
- Even though Hibari only has good things to say about his family, if they didn't go looking for him when they ran away, what does that imply?
	- Since he ran away, they obviously weren't supporting him in any form. And if he ran away, it would also mean his family initially denied his desire to go to the city in the first place. So then, why would they do so?
		1) They wanted to keep him as the heir to their phantom thief lineage. They did know where he was, but simply didn't care to retrieve him. 
		2) They never found him or didn't care to look, and so Hibari successfully escaped his lineage.
- Since his family didn't support him--as he had to run away--he may have spent his vacation days and weekends taking part-time jobs.
- It's possible he may have also forged his details to find places to stay or rent, and stolen to supplement his income for schooling and living, depending on the school's rules about part-time jobs.

- To maximise his ability as a thief, various parts of his body may have been trained overtime, or he may have habits that are no longer necessary. Stuff ingrained into him due to his family lineage.
	- Burning his fingerprints when gloves aren't enough. Painful.
	- Red-light adaptation. Night vision training to adapt to low-light, which causes some mild photophobia (he can't stare at them directly for long). Slower adaptation to brightness, risk of headaches and eye strain.
	- Absolute silence when walking, always toe-first. Low steps means he stumbles on terrain he isn't used to.
	- Can suppress his heart rate for emergency situations, and effectively play dead. Doing it too long risks blackout.
	- Ligament training for less painful dislocation. But it's still unpleasant. Makes his arms and wrists more prone to popping unexpectedly. (Could be why he wears an arm brace frequently.)
	- Frog breathing, to exhale without moving muscles in his body. However, it makes it harder to breathe when he's sick or hurt.
	- Temperature control to mask against IR sensors. Makes him cold, though.
