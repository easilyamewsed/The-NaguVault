- Excellent at disguises.
- His role in Voltaction is as the technological scout, and is best at providing tactical insight. He also tends to be over-prepared (in the *Opening Today* CD he has a welding tool with him for some reason).
- His physical ability isn't good at all, especially not compared to the others. But he knows some basic self-defense that apparently surpasses Seraph's previous targets.



--- end-column --- 

- His ability to gather information means his network or network access is wide.
- He has a driver's license and owns a car.
- He can cook, but apparently his form of doing so is dangerous. (*"My nails get in the way..."*)

**Spy Glasses**
