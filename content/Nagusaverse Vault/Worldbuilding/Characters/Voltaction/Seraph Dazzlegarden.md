- Resistance to poisons is more so that he just ignores their effects.

 - A wide array of knowledge on killing methods and cleanup.
 - The heartbeat is a little irregular, but behaves normally in movement. Athletically normal, aside from the fact he's physically superior.

 - His methods of murder or suppression are probably riskier than they should be.

#### Background
###### General 
- An ex-assassin from a family of assassins, who now works for [[Room 4S]] as the only agent, and as a member of [[VOLTACTION]].
- His partner is [[Shikinagi Akira]].
- Doesn't kill people anymore; he was not an assassin by choice, and was forced into it by his family.
- Shows some tendency to 'wish for death', as shown in the *-undertake any request-* voice drama, going as far as to inadvertently skew the mission to get himself killed  (to everyone's displeasure).
###### High school 
- He and [[Shikinagi Akira]] were enrolled at [[Erfolg College]]to carry out a long-term undercover mission for their previous employers.
	- While they had worked together a lot prior to this, they didn't see eye-to-eye.
	- Aft discovering Akira's plan to double-cross his organisation, he apprehends and attacks Akira.
	- However, Akira was able to crack Seraph's armour, citing their friendship, and convince him to leave their organisations and escape with him.
	- - In the *-Memories of Nostalgia- Formation* CD, he helped Akira enlist [[Fura Kanato]]and [[Watarai Hibari]] to help them gather information they'd use as blackmail material to leverage their freedom.
	- He was prepared to sacrifice his own freedom for Akira's, but was fortunately let off the hook with [[Fura Kanato]]'s intervention.
- Seraph falsified his age when enrolling, so was submitted to the same class as the others.
###### Headcanons
- Due to his upbringing (unique even in Voltaction), his emotional maturation may be somewhat stunted.
