#### Background
###### General
- The son of a mafia boss and leader of [[Voltaction]].
- [[Watarai Hibari]]'s partner.
- Representative of the [[Venti Group]] conglomerate by day.
	- The owner of [[Caf√© Zeffiro]], the front of operations for [[Room 4S]] and where Hibari works as a part-timer.
	- Owns other related locations ([[Bar Libeccio]], [[Buffet Aliseo]], [[Facile Estate]], [[Grecale]], [[Pizzeria Euro]], [[Ristorante Maestrale]]).
- His name is Japanese, `but it's implied the mafia he's part of is Italian, given the name of his establishments and knowledge of customs.`
	- Doesn't intend to succeed his father as don (would prefer to 'do things that are actually fun'), but has concerns with the dark side of the family business.
	- Still involved in it to some degree, but activities are kept separate from the [[Venti Group]].
	- It's yet to be determined if any of his close friends know that his 'mafia upbringing' runs deeper than just 'associate'.
- His family did not mistreat him, and he loves them just the same. He can't leave the mafia because of his attachments and responsibilities. (Confirmed characterisation -- *Escape VP*)
- Met Hibari during his childhood, but it seems like only Kanato remembers.
	- `Likely a vacation home/safehouse in Tohoku.`
	- Didn't have any friends his own age aside from Hibari that one time.
###### High school 
- Appears to have been home-schooled (at least attended kindergarten), but convinced his father to allow him to attend [[Erfolg College]] under conditions he still operate as a member of his father's organisation.
	- An honor student. He became the president of the student council in second year.
	- As Kanato is able to (easily) convince [[Shikinagi Akira]] and [[Seraph Dazzlegarden]]'s handlers to set them free through intimidation and `potentially dangling his status`, `I suspect that their organisations are connected in some manner to the [[Fura Family]].`
	- His primary motivation for helping Akira and Seraph appears to be sympathy. Otherwise, seems like any actions that don't align with his parents' vision for him are just attempts to get back at them, piss them off, or establish some distance between them and him. (Confirmed characterisation -- *Memories of Nostalgia*)
	- `Hibari's family may also be related,` since Hibari uses the Watarai family crest instead of his own in his cover of *Shanti*, designed to match Kanato's cover of *Mafia*.

###### Headcanons
- Overuse of [[Fura Kanato#Skills & Tools|target sight]] may result in temporary blindness or loss of colour vision.
- His current relationship with his father, while not bad, might be a little conflicted?

##### Character Bible
###### Core Characterisation 
1. *The regular*
	- Goofy. Whines about unimportant things. A bit witty and just a tad sharp. Fundamentally stubborn.
	- He is a cheerful guy with high emotional range. A good deal of confidence himself (not narcissism, but certainly ego) that also lends him a lot of self-pride.
	- He enjoys engaging with life as he pleases, and takes thorough advantage of independence. A 'solo player' mindset.
	- Playful and energetic when engaging with others, you get the sense he 'never stops moving'. But in relaxed environments, he's something of a lazy cat.
	- Quick reflexes, clever problem-solving, decisiveness and clear communication lend to the atmosphere of a 'leader'. A forward-thinking and logically clean person.
	- It's said he's fun to be around, and he has an 'aura of attracting people'. Charisma, or the ability to rally.
	- He's fundamentally self-conscious and has high standards of himself, and a little shy with strangers when he's allowed to be.
	- He gets bored of things easily, and doesn't waste time on menial tasks if they can be avoided. He just wants to do what's fun.
	- He flusters, but is generally quite good at taking praise and putting on airs. His society training (mafia heir) makes him socially clever, and good at keeping composure under almost all pressures.
	- But since he won't talk about anything that's seriously troubling him, he'll swallow needles (metaphorically).
2. *The heir apparent*
	- Kanato's leadership skills, pride, and self-expectation come from his mafia lineage.
	- His mafia relations are something he takes pride in, even if he doesn't want to inherit the Family and disagrees with how his father goes about some things.
	- Even so, a healthy family upbringing (even if isolated from others of his age) has fostered loyalty and love in Kanato, allowing room for his understanding of necessary evils to grow.
	- While Kanato chooses to believe in the best of people, this thinking has shaped his mindset. The underworld is cutthroat-- resourcefulness, ruthlessness, manipulation and judgement are all necessary for survival.
	- Perhaps the reason he's so hard on himself is because a lack of precision gets you killed. In other words-- his pride in himself is earned, not innate.
	- He believes himself capable of taking what he wants (shown in his management and ambassadorship for Venti) and exhibits a degree of covetousness and/or selfishness.
	- While he doesn't shun his mafia side, he obviously exhibits some desire for distance (his breaking away from the Family and moral disagreements). Though he's unlikely to outright loathe himself or the actions he may be forced to take because of his status, it's also something he refuses to give up (because if anyone is going to do it, it should probably be him.)
	- This lifestyle may lend to a sense of loneliness and/or isolation, especially surrounded by people who have split from their underworld lives (two of which he helped with.)
	- Additionally, his mixed feelings about his role in the mafia may cause him to lean into a more solo-player line of thinking in certain situations.
	- Ultimately, the mafia is something he doesn't WANT to do, but does anyway, because he is the only one who can. While he is proud of his skills, strength, and reliability, he isn't proud of the outcomes of his participation or actions. He doesn't shun himself for what he is, but is self-aware and sympathetic enough to understand *it isn't a good person to be, or what he really wants for himself*.
	- He does it because he believes in its necessity, and the good it *can* actually do. Think power vacuums, brotherhood, gang control, etcetera. Stuff that can really only be achieved through crime.
3. *The covetous*
	- Kanato strives for his ideal life (re: distance from the mafia, Venti, Voltaction, and how he chooses to present himself to others.)
	- A single-raised child, home-schooled and kept from his peers, groomed as the heir to an underworld enterprise has taught him business sense and opportunity.
	- He himself has spoken about 'liking his own things/space' and 'being possessive' (VODs). Kanato doesn't like to share. Combined, these make for a very goal-oriented and forward thinking logic system.
	- Basically, underlying personality and environment factors point toward a measure of selfishness. A selfishness he can *act on*, because he has the confidence to think himself capable.
	- **Character canon event:** When he met Hibari at a young age, he was shown a glimpse of freedom and companionship. A world that he would never have been able to grasp were it not shown to him early enough. This is perhaps the root of his selfishness and desire for independence from the mafia. He saw a boy that looked like freedom, and selfishly pursued that boy and his freedom all the way to Voltaction.
	- This caused Kanato to form *ideals about his life and self* as he would grow further. Even though he exhibits doubts about his leadership and place with Voltaction, he continues to stay with them despite knowing he could be dragged back to the mafia at any time (on his father's whim). Just as Kanato is unwilling to be heir, his father is just as unwilling to choose anyone else to succeed him.
	- It's fundamentally *doubt*, and a question of whether or not he deserves to stay, because he doesn't see himself as the same as them. Yet knowing the consequences of his connections and his own doubts, he selfishly continues to stay regardless.
	- Because of this, he may acknowledge his own selfishness and berate himself for it. Kanato is a person who can grasp the full scope of a situation quite well, so he'd be able to understand how dire the potential consequences could be. But he's the type of person who won't give up anything-- so he can only say 'this is how it is'.
	- *Even if it endangers the others, his desire to stay is great enough that it outweighs that consequence*. As such, it follows that he's the sort who *won't stop trying to attain what he wants or give things up, unless something explicitly prevents him from doing so.*
	- The only times he gives up is when he decides it's not worth it, in which case, he defers quickly. These two things combined can create a *defeatist nature* that comes from a *powerlessness*, because-- despite his skills and wit-- he can never truly escape the mafia. Either he gets what he wants or doesn't waste time trying. It's a pain otherwise.
	- In order to protect others, *he would selfishly hurt them* if he believed it he had no other choice. *He places his own desires above that of others* in high stakes situations, *though many of those desires may come from a fundamentally altruistic place.* (ie: if leaving Hibari behind is going to keep him safe, then it doesn't matter how much Hibari begs him not to go.)
	- Decisiveness means he absolutely won't change his mind without drastic circumstances or opportunities that allow it.
	- But because of his how he was raised and sees himself, he may fail to acknowledge the *goodness* in his decisions and see only the things that hurt others. Even though he acknowledges the guilt, he is likely to commit to an action, hence a self-imposed idea of *selfishness and ego*
4. *The martyr*
	- But because Kanato is still in the mafia, while being surrounded by whom he believes are good people now free of their criminal lives, he may feel a sense of isolation that leads to particular thinking.
	- To begin with, he has a habitual solo player's mindset (MoN, VODs) that causes him to tend to try solving problems on his own. It matches his stubbornness and authority.
	- Combined with being someone who acts selfishly, his needs in high-stakes situations ultimately come second to the people he cares about-- but he may go about solving these conflicts in *unbecoming ways that may hurt those same people*.
	- Basically, *he doesn't care how they end up seeing him, as long as his own ideas are met*. He would make efforts to do things cleanly, but if things get messy, 'that's just how it is'.
	- Additionally, his sense of isolation due to being the only active underworld member in Volta, he is very likely to *isolate them from these things about himself*. Basically, he doesn't want them to concern themselves with his darker sides. It's not a lack of trust for Kanato, but it *is* a matter of efficiency and companion safety.
	- In keeping these aspects of his life away from them, it also allows him to *preserve the idealism he finds in Volta*. The mafia doesn't concern Volta-- that's personal, family matters. He can and will handle them alone.
	- If it's decided that **Kanato's mafia ties help keep Volta safe, because there's no way they would go untargeted given their pasts**, then that's double on reason not to talk about it.
5. *The efficient
	- As someone who does what is necessary, Kanato retains a sense of ruthlessness. His grooming as mafia heir and life experience is likely to have led him to shield his own vulnerabilities.
	- Also that these vulnerabilities clash with his ideal (untroubled) life. In other words, his daily life is an *escapism from his insecurities and shadows*.
	- While he does not lack sympathy and has a strong sense of moral fiber, he will still do whatever he deems necessary, and rationalise it through the lens of survival.
	- His self-awareness makes it hard to believe he'd be doing anything because people are 'scum', unless it's something somehow worse than killing. He doesn't see himself as a vigilante hero, and will likely try for compromise before anything else. But if *bad things are the only way to do what he has to do, then that's how it has to be.*
	- That he knows he isn't above *being a bad guy* probably even aids in his decision-making. *You don't survive the underworld without knowing how to take what you want.* It doesn't matter if you wish it was different-- this is how your life is.
	- As such, he never complains about his life. The only complaints he exhibits are superficial, or expressions of minor displeasure about something.
6. *The boy*
	- Even so, a person can't help but wish. Fundamentally, Kanato is still a good person. And that makes him naturally someone who wasn't built for the life foisted upon him.
	- His childhood-- socially stunted up until high school but not socially stupid, mind you-- was isolated and probably left him yearning. There was time spent on training just as much as there was time his family entertained him. A young master's life with a mafia boss for a father is still filled with work and nannies.
	- While he may not have wanted for anything-- toys, food, company-- *he still wouldn't have gotten to play with other children.* (Which is why Hibari's role in his childhood is so important.)
	- As such, Kanato-- when comfortable, when permitted-- expresses strokes of "immaturity" (in the loosest sense). He is playful, prankster, and thoroughly enjoys screwing around as much as he pleases. He has a desire to try a lot of different things.
	- He is still spoilt (by luxury and wealth) and so likes things that are new (he seems careless with spend therapy lol), stylish, etc. A materialist (recently seeking to fill his empty home.)
	- He acts more like a fool than anything else, simply because he's not allowed to in any other environments.
	- Perhaps this allowance is what also makes him a little possessive and selfish about things and people. It could be at these times he feels blessed (allowed to be the way he wants).
	- He isn't stoic or emotionally stunted, and is probably a more reactionary person than most would expect. Since his confidence and pride is decently high, I imagine most things slide off him. But the things that cut a little deeper (cruelty, a lack of popularity, efforts that don't show results) probably wound him depending on how he feels/the situation. He probably also enjoys some measure of attention from people he likes.
	- Because success in the underworld is *strongly tied to results over efforts,* there may be thought logic that leads him to feel *unworthy of someone's time or attention.* This can likely apply to various contexts.
	- All those same reasons are probably why he clams up when it comes to rocky interpersonal things. The more complex a situation and the higher the stakes (the more important he sees the person's opinion of him to be), the more likely he is to worry himself into inaction. Probably why he strongly prefers open communication-- unless the concern is much more complicated.
	- Ultimately he is optimistic. And while he has the normalcy he works so hard to maintain, I'm sure a part of him still wishes life was simpler.
	- And so the layers loop, because they're intrinsic to one another.

###### Relationships with others
**When it comes to Hibari...**
- Hibari is his lodestar.
- Representing the wings of absolute freedom, Hibari is who showed Kanato what it looked like when they were young.
