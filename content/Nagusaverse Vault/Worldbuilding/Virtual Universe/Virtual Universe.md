##### Overview
- The noun used for the endless number of worlds created by the [[Virtual System]].
- This refers to [[Branches|branches]], [[Worldbuilding/Virtual Universe/Otherworlds/Otherworlds|otherworlds]], and the myriad locations on [[Virtual Earth]] in all of their permutations.
- The universe is vast. Nothing is the same everywhere.

##### Glitches
###### Dimensional Gaps
- Spaces where the barrier between [[Otherworlds|otherworlds]] is too thin, or has become corrupted.
	- Beings sometimes slip through, traverse, or find a way to deliberately open these gaps.
- The system runs a diagnostic to repair them on a cycle, but oftentimes misses them.
	- It may also ignore them if it does not know how to repair them, in order to avoid crashing itself trying to find a solution.
- Some beings are able to open dimensional gaps by nature. The majority, however, are not.
- The particularly clever may be able to develop the skills to track or open gaps through the means of technology, or breaching the system in some way.
