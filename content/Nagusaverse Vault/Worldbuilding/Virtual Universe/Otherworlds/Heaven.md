## Environment

#### Physicality
- A strange metropolis dwelling past [[Heaven#The Twelve Gates|the Twelve Gates]]. 
- Because of its complete monochromaticity, the sky looks like another wall, utterly indecipherable from the square, white buildings that fill every corner of sight.
- The white seems endless. The place has no understanding of curves, except for entrances, which are always archways and never doors. It's a matter of efficiency.
- Pathways are straight and narrow, with very few wide streets breaking up cubicle housing. However, this is a surplus of windows, which doesn't really make a difference when everything is white.
- Angels do not sleep, so their houses lack a bed or any manner of amenities. Just as many are filled with papers, folders, and file cabinets, which are regularly collected and taken to the [[Heaven#Heavenly Archives|Heavenly Archives]] for processing.

###### Climate & Weather
- Suffused with [[Divine Grace]], Heaven is never dark and exists in perpetual, unchanging light.
- There is no feel to it. No breeze, weather, or variation. The light touches everything but has no sensation.
- This light is also what gives Heaven its perpetual monochromaticity. It is said to be the divine light of God.

### Major Locations

##### Purgatory
- Endless, non-compromising limbo.
- The Grace of Heaven that pours through the Twelve Gates turns it perpetually monochrome.
- Unlike Heaven, which is white, the endlessness of Purgatory is grey.
- Where the souls of the recently demised tend to end up– but many of them disappear.
###### The Twelve Gates
- The entryways to Heaven.
- Twelve rectangular doorways of light in a row, standing at roughly double the height of an average man.
- The Twelve Gates are sparsely busy, as the number of souls who reach the Gates through Purgatory and are actually qualified to pass are few.
- Even so, the Gates are where pure spirits pass through to Heaven to begin their servitude as angels.
- It is said each gate was once guarded by an [[Heaven#Archangels|archangel]], but if that's the case, they aren't anymore.

##### Heavenly Archives


##### Throne of God

## Diseases, Sickness and Deficiency
---
- Angels do not get sick, and are incapable of feeling pain.
- Angels are only susceptible to two conditions: **Fracturing** and **Falling**.

###### Fracturing
- Occurs when an angel breaks a law or questions their principles, creating a _psychological association_ between disobedience and sin.
- This causes their halo to _fracture,_ with the severity reflecting the angel's perception of their violation.
- A fully fractured halo results in the angel _falling._ Fractures can occur instantly or gradually.
- Fracturing also happens upon an angel's death, though the death of an angel is nigh-impossible.
- While irreversible, fracturing can be delayed if the angel suppresses their doubts about authority or existence.

###### Falling
- Falling occurs when an angel opposes His will or questions Heaven's laws.
- It often follows fracturing and is rooted in the angel's _psychology,_ not divine punishment.
- When an angel's worldview conflicts with Heaven's norms, they may perceive this as defiance, causing further fracturing.
- Recognizing their fractures, angels often spiral into believing they are destined to fall, making the fall inevitable.
- A fallen angel is no angel at all, and therefore they are stripped of their Grace upon falling.

## Philosophy, Religion & Mythology

##### The True Origin
- The Virtual World is an infinitely expanding simulation that generates new realities by extracting data from the minds of its autonomous inhabitants.
- Angels were not created by God, nor did they create religion; they were _created by humanity's belief in religion._ The Virtual World gave form to humanity's religious concepts.
- God does not exist. The laws and foundations angels follow are not divine but shaped by humanity's expectations of religion– angels exist to fulfil humanity's desire for something to blame, believe in, and seek forgiveness from.
- Angels, perceiving the Bible’s depiction of them as truth, believe their purpose is divinely ordained. They blindly pursue this purpose because it gives them meaning; without it, they would be nothing.
- Over time, angelic society forgot the illusion of their origins, evolving into a rigid theocracy that serves a God who never existed.
- Angels who begin to question their purpose or realize this truth face an existential crisis. The resulting _self-deception_– that their questioning must be heresy– fractures their halos, leading them to fall, destroyed by the very illusion that sustains their existence.


---
## Laws
- The angels have but one true law, and the rest are rules that merely assist in the efficiency of their day-to-day lives.
- The violation of any law is a direct insult to the principles of angelicism, and results in a fracturing.

**The Law of Non-Interference:**
- Angels are not permitted to directly interfere in the lives of humans. In doing so, they lower themselves to a devil's selfish tendency and show desire to lord power over the lesser.


---
### Realm Relations
##### [[Virtual Universe#Virtual Earth|Human Realm]]


##### [[Hell]]
- The angels are locked in perpetual war with the devils of Hell. By nature, yes, but also in principle.
- Very few angels have befriended devils– and those who do are doomed to fall.
