### Area 6: The Outskirts
---
#### Overview
- *A vast and sparsely populated ring that marks the beginning of the Demon World’s true wilderness.*
- A transitional zone between the relative safety of the city’s inner districts and the chaotic expanse of **Area 7** and the infinite wastelands beyond.
- Vital for resource extraction and defense, as many battles are better taken place where there will be no casualties or property damage.
- But it is also dangerous, as ferals and lessers constantly assault its borders.
- Sprawling quarries, barren landscapes, and minimal infrastructure.
- Few demons live here permanently, as it is primarily a work zone for miners and militia patrols.
	- The *militia* patrols to prevent feral and lesser incursions into the city.
	- Area 6 is constantly under siege by ferals and especially lessers, which are drawn to the city from even far corners by the high concentrations of mana produced by the population.
	- Patrol routes are extensive and dangerous, requiring demons to stay in this area for extended periods.
	- These patrols also *retrieve survivors who accidentally slip into the Demon World through the network, particularly near breaches between dimensions*.
	- Watchtowers and emergency outposts are used by the militia and mining teams, and act as temporary shelters for working soldiers.

- Also a designated execution and exile zone, where criminals, traitors, or feral demons are dealt with.
- Exile rituals are carried out here, casting out demons deemed too dangerous or unworthy of reintegration.
- Some condemned demons are intentionally left to fend for themselves against the ferals, a fate considered worse than death.
