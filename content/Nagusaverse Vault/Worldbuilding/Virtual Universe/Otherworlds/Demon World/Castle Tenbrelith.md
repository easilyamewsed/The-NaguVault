##### About

> [!The Demon World's Sole City]

> "Rising from the endless, dark plain, the Demon World– that is, the city– rests upon a solitary hill. It is not difficult to see, with its towers and castle glowing with mana geodes. The concentric rings of the city spiral outward from the castle, and the land stretches flat in every direction. Unbroken and bleak, and yet the demons have no more defense than some paltry walls. I wonder if their arrogance is reflected in the placement of their settlement, as they are vulnerable to the open air and whims of the land pressing against them. The wilderness beyond seemed eager to claim what they so boldly showcased, but I believe this what the demons intend– taking their dominion over a world that seems ready to consume them. Pride, it seems, is both their strength and their folly.

> There are spats of geysers leading toward it, which I imagine, are part of the water system they seem to have mastered. I remember seeing a network of rivers, dredged from and disappearing into the ground. I suspect they rely on subterranean water. In my very short stay, I learnt that mana flows well with water, as it does with blood. Perhaps it is something similar to the way oxygen dissolves in water, and this may be why the city has terraformed its system– to safely expel the concentrations of mana that tend to accumulate. From what I gathered, keeping high amounts of mana in one space for too long is incredibly dangerous. Given how compact the city is, and that it is inhabited by a race that both absorbs and exudes it, I loathe to imagine the possibilities.

>There is a beauty in the balance they maintain, though I cannot help but see it as precarious. But, perhaps it is not their character to bend knee to nature."
