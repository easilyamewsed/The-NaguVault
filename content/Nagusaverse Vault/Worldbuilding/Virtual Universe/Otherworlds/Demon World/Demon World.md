- The Demon World is neither the place of the living nor the dead. It is not like Hell, and has more in common with purgatory or limbo.
- The Demon World exists in an entirely different 'format' to the human world, unique in every aspect. It resembles something closer to *Yomi* in Japanese mythology.
- *Yomi* has been and is inhabited, just as the Demon World is, despite its sparsity.

*SYSTEM REPORT: 2434:\VirtualWorld0\DemonWorld*
*[1] The Demon World is a [[Otherworlds#Dimensional Otherworlds|dimensional otherworld]].
[2] There are two contexts for how the Demon World is referred to:*
*1. In the context of being a realm, where it is being referred to as a whole.*
*2. In the context of being a city, place, or home. Where the term 'Demon World' is confined to the city in which civilised demons base themselves.*
*[3] Human survival in the Demon World is **highly improbable**, though certain otherworlders may find it habitable.*

> "In all my time surfing the network, I had seldom actually done so by way of accident.
>I had known little of the Demon World– which, in my encounters with various inhabitants, I had surmised to be different to the Demon World of Helesta, or Hell. I had been sheltering from a storm in an alcove at the base of a mountain– an alcove that I found to be rather deep. It is in my nature as an explorer to investigate, and so off I went. And the cave went on and on, until I found myself unable to turn back. The way had disappeared.
> 		 
>I understand my lifestyle is very unappealing to most, and I truly had felt no remorse in it until I was met with the unrelenting blackness spread before me. Perpetual, unending. I cannot guess as to the Demon World's larger purpose in the scope of the Virtual Universe, but it is an inherently unkind, inhospitable land. Roamed by unholy, monstrous creatures of loping shapes... and odd ones, too, if my eyes did not deceive me. In old legends, they are claimed to be guards, and I wonder if this realm is the originator of the Japanese tales of "Yomi". But I argue there is nothing to guard but wastelands and mountains. The demons I had met– the ones who made no attempts on my life– had never spoken of how vast their motherland was, and I found myself lucky that the slip in the network was close to the nexus city.
>		
>I was picked up at the edge of the border by a group of civilian patrolmen, who seemed fittingly surprised at my survival in-so-far. Though I dwelt there for a number of days, I never once heard a name for the metropolis the demons inhabit, but it is simultaneously medieval and modern. For instance, the castle looked as if ripped straight from gothic fantasy. But the outer districts, where I spent most of my time, reminded me more of the suburban housing of my own town far, far away.</
>		
>With fortune, I eventually returned to my origin lands– apparently, it is not impossible for mortals to slip through the cracks. I was not the first and would not be the last. In the past, it would not have been possible for me to have survive walking those streets. Even then, I felt hungry eyes upon me. Somehow, these creatures make their living here... I do not think they are aware of how fractious and disorderly their way of life is. But if there is more to be said, it is that– in some strange way– their endless realm meshes liminality with naturality. I felt as if I was passing, not beyond or below, just through. And, might I be called odd in sense, I felt rather at peace."

## Environment

#### Physicality
- An infinite wasteland of darkness, with biomes ranging from flatlands to mountains. There is even flowing water.
- The Demon World expands infinitely– both outwards unto the horizon, but also down. Nobody has ever mined to the bottom.
	- Some demons may be brave enough to travel, but there is little point in it other than exile or danger.
- Like its inhabitants, it is both unchanging and eternal, promising perpetuality.

###### Climate & Weather
- The Demon World does not have seasons. There is no sun or moon.
- Not near freezing temperatures, but not particularly warm either.
- [[Manastorm|Manastorms]] are a natural disaster that may cause the sky and land to distort, change colour, erupt, fracture, or mutate.
- Auroras created from mana may also appear in the sky or air.
- The only natural light is emitted by mana geodes that grow within the landscape.

![[Mana#Overview]]

----
### Design

- The Demon World is an expansive realm, but the entirety of the population is essentially nested in the city surrounding the King's castle.
- The entirety of the race is concentrated in that area, and therefore the city itself knows no name and is inherently referred to by its people as the 'Demon World'.
- The Demon World is considered the *absolute center* of the entire realm due to the fact that the edges of the world are unknown.

#### A Geographical Hierarchy

- The Demon World city is a sprawling metropolis structured in **concentric rings** radiating outward from the **King's castle** at its center.
- The rings are divided into areas, each serving distinct roles and housing specific classes of demons, from the highest nobility to commoners and outcasts.
- In the Demon World, *strength is not only a virtue but a necessity*.
- *The demon race places extreme value on strength– in their world, survival is of the fittest. As such, strength– decided by factors like [[Mana#Mana Recesses|mana recesses]], combat prowess, intelligence, and physical capability– is proportionate to authority.* These factors can also be hereditary.
- Proximity to the center denotes strength; the lower the number on your address, the greater your power.
- Strength here refers not just to raw power but also to tactical intelligence, resourcefulness, and dominance in demon society.

## Inhabitants

#### Civilised Demons
- Construct Demon World society.
- Intelligence and sense equal to that of humans, with a strong focus on mana, strength and hierarchy.
- Civilized demons vary widely in appearance, abilities, and nature. Some closely resemble humans, while others have monstrous traits. ( [[Otherworld Bestiary]]→ )

--- start-multi-column: Overview
```column-settings
border: disabled

number of columns: 2
column width: [40%, 40%, 10%]
```

###### Purebloods
- Form the majority of the Demon World population.
- *Have a higher number of fatal weaknesses.*
- The *pinnacle of demon evolution*, exhibiting regal strength and standing, and generally known to be unanimously beautiful or handsome.
- Their lifespans exceed others of their species.
- They are war-like and/or survival-oriented, and are normally incredibly selfish, egotistical, narrow-minded and prideful.
- While most demons historically regarded humans as inferior or as prey, this perspective has shifted slightly due to hybridization and interworld treaties.
 ⠀

###### Half-bloods
- *Half-demon, half-human.* Extremely uncommon.
- They are rare, as many demons remain repulsed by such a manner of fraternisation with the human species, but *increasingly influential*. Traditionalists resent them.
- They have a *reduced number of fatal weaknesses*.
- Less likely to succumb to mana overexposure or essence starvation.
- Higher degrees of adaptability to different environments.
- Due the Demon World's emphasis on *strength above all else,* half-blood demons have an advantage, and, should they decide to do so, can ascend high in standing.
- Have a *lower drive for destruction and other demon-like tendencies.*
- Deeper mana recesses due to *a greater number of blood cells* make them less prone to combustion.


--- end-column ---

###### Hybrids
- Demons that are hybrid of two demon species.
- Differences between them and purebloods depends solely on the species and traits of their parents.
- Generally have a higher rate of adaptability, as they have more options in *essence* to substitute for.
- Are more prone to species-specific diseases.
- Are more prone to *mana overexposure or combustions.*

⠀
###### Guardians
- Not demons in the traditional sense.
- Few in number, they are special and rare entities with entirely different temperaments.
- They are unlikely to actually be in the Demon World at all, and may instead be instinctually tasked with guarding ruptures in the network, or even the spaces between dimensions.
- Also known as gatekeepers.
- While other demons are aware of their existence, the guardians' scarcity makes them as good as myth in most cases. Very few have interacted with a guardian.
- They are soloists and individuals, and mostly exist outside of demon law and awareness as they do not live within the domain.
- It is unknown whether they have innate mana.

```

###### Lesser Demons
- Lesser demons are creatures that more closely resemble monsters or animals in behaviour and intellect.
- They are sentient but lack the intelligence or sophistication of full-blooded demons.
- Often hostile and animalistic, lesser demons are driven by instinct rather than strategy.
- They have a perpetual drive to obtain mana, as they are fueled by it.
- They are frequently used as tools of war or experimentation by more intelligent demons, that have often been outcast as *feral*.
- Some lesser demons are actually *non-hostile, and these ones tend to be small and kept as pets.*
⠀
- **Mana mutations**: Formed when ambient mana warps animals or weaker demons into monstrous forms.
- **Diseased transformations**: Certain curses and diseases can degrade demons into lesser forms.
- **Environment-induced**: Exposure to unstable mana zones in the Demon World can lead to lesser demon creation.
 ⠀


--- end-column ---

###### Feral Demons
- Demons who have *lost their sanity or surrendered their sense to primal instincts*.
- *Outlaws, criminals and practitioners of illegal arts are also labelled feral demons.*
	- The Demon World does not offer redemption
- They are highly dangerous and feared even within demon society.
- Feral demons are *unpredictable and violent*, attacking indiscriminately.
- Unlike lesser demons, they retain their former power, making them significant threats.
- They are often hunted down by the militia or military forces of the Demon World.

--- end-column ---

--- end-multi-column 

---
## Disease, Sickness & Deficiency

- The Demon World harbors unique afflictions, often tied to its mana-rich environment.
- These diseases can affect demons of all types, ferals, and even lessers.
- Demons do not contract human sicknesses.

--- start-multi-column: Overview
```column-settings

```

###### Crumbling Fever
- A degenerative disease caused by defects or failures in *a demon's [[Mana#Mana Flow|regenerative processes]].
- Leads to the breakdown of a demon’s body and [[Mana#Mana Recesses|mana recesses]].
- This process is often quick, occurring in a matter of days.
- A rare disease, but more common in demons with deeper mana recesses.
⠀
###### Draemuril Venis
- Also known as *marrowblight* or *hollowbone*.
- Caused by a defect in a *demon's [[Mana#Mana Flow|mana flow]].
- Eats away at the bone marrow, making it impossible for the body to produce new blood cells.
- Fatigue, paleness, muscles aches, bruises, bleeding, mana instability, haemorrhaging, bone deformity.
- Demons often succumb to mana combustion or essence starvation as a result.
⠀
###### Essence Starvation
- Results from a lack of essence or essence-like sustenance, which many demons require to maintain their strength and sanity.
- Symptoms include weakness, fatigue, muscle aches, migraines, hallucinations, and eventual ferality.
- Demons who've gone feral from essence starvation are prone to dying if they are unable to feed.
- Happens the most in **Areas 5, 6 and 7**.
⠀

--- end-column ---

###### Mana Combustion
- When a demon absorbs *too much mana with recesses that are not deep enough.*
- Caused by overexposure and lack of mana expulsion. Spontaneous combustion.
- Hybrids are especially prone.
⠀
###### Mana Poisoning
- Caused by overexposure to *unstable or corrupted mana*.
- Symptoms include physical degradation, madness, and eventual transformation into a lesser demon.
⠀
###### Outburst Flu
- A contagious sickness caused by the  [[Amplifloris|amplifloris]] plant within the Demon World.
- Demons who have contracted it are prone to emotional outbursts as well as fever-like symptoms.
- Non-fatal. Passes within the week.
- This disease is contractable by humans in the form of [[Hanahaki Disease|hanahaki disease]].
⠀
###### Vitamin and Mineral Deficiency
- The vast majority of demons, being reliant on essence or essence-like substances to survive, also suffer vitamin and mineral deficiencies in relation to these substances.
- For example, [[Vampire|vampires]] are more prone to blood loss and iron deficiency.

## Philosophy, Religion & Mythology

#### Philosophical Principles
The Demon World lacks a strict moral code or structured religious system. Instead, its inhabitants follow principles rooted in their nature, environment, and societal needs. These philosophies shape their worldview, emphasizing survival, strength, and the unyielding flow of mana.

###### Societal Beliefs: The Ten Virtues
--- start-multi-column: Overview
```column-settings
border: disabled
shadow: disabled
number of columns: 2
column width: [40%, 40%, 10%]
```

**"Strength is virtue."**
*Strength is the axis upon which all morality turns.*
- Strength is not merely physical or magical power but also encompasses wit, cunning, and resilience.
- The weak have value only in their ability to serve or better themselves under the tutelage of the strong. Protecting subordinates is seen as both a burden and a mark of power.
- The strong lead because they prove themselves capable of withstanding and conquering challenges. Leadership is earned.
	- Masters or nobles who fail to protect their subordinates are seen as unworthy.
- Strength by inherited traits is seen as fortune, something that is begrudged, but respected.
- Fights for dominance are viewed as natural and necessary; the cutthroat nature of the Demon World can only be handled by the bestiary.
- This philosophy creates a society where mentorship and rivalry coexist, forming a volatile balance between cooperation and individualism.
⠀
**"Power is absolute."**
*Power is the absolute authority. Those who are in authority belong there.*
- Those who know they are weaker must know their place and defer.
- Authority stems from might, and challenges to authority are viewed as a natural part of societal function.
- The weak may rise in proving themselves, and the strong must constantly defend their position.
- This fosters a 'never rest' mentality, where complacency is therefore considered the greatest sin.
- The "never rest" mentality extends beyond combat into intellectual and magical pursuits.
	- Mana mastery is seen as an ongoing responsibility to oneself and one's place in the hierarchy.
	- Failure to innovate or improve oneself risks one’s position in the hierarchy.
	- Succession in noble houses is determined by combat and displays of strength.
- A challenge must never be refused, lest you be seen as weak or unfit.
- Even the [[Royal House|royal family]] is constantly scrutinised, and challenged to prove they deserve their authority.
- "Stagnation is death" is a common saying tied to this principle.
⠀
**"Mana, the Lifeblood."**
*Mana is sacred, representing both a personal and universal life force.*
- It is a privilege, not a right, to wield mana.
	- Misuse or neglect of mana is viewed as moral failure.
	- Mana is the essence of existence, and must be granted the utmost respect.
	- Mana flows through all things, and its dispersal upon death into the atmosphere ties into reincarnation beliefs.
- Rituals or practices exist to honour mana's return to the Demon World upon one’s death.
- Philosophical debates might revolve around whether mana is something demons own or something they borrow and must repay.
- Demons do not interfere with natural disasters caused by mana, nor do they seek to over-industrialise it.
- Many demons understand mana to be a gift, granted to them to make them higher beings.
	- This point is double-sided. It causes superiority complexes and discrimination, but humbles demons in the use of their 'gift'.
⠀
**Eternalism**
- The philosophy that *existence is eternal.*
- The infinite nature of the Demon World reflects the belief in an unbroken cycle of existence.
- The wastelands and endless underground caverns symbolize eternal life and death as part of the same continuum.
- Demons see themselves as pieces of an eternal network: *they are born of mana, live to use it, and return it upon death*.
- Their immortality is not absolute, and many die early deaths in the Demon World. *When demons die, they dissolve into ash, and their mana is dispersed into the atmosphere.*
- Reincarnation is not romanticized; it is viewed pragmatically as a simple truth.
- Fosters a deep sense of fatalism in many demons.
- For others, this fosters apathy or despair, especially in those with *lower destructive drives*, resulting in mental illnesses like depression or susceptibility to [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Outburst Flu|outburst flu]].


--- end-column ---

**"Pride is identity."**
*Pride is the cornerstone of a demon's identity and actions.*
- Demons must never diminish themselves or allow their reputation to falter.
- Insults and defeats are viewed as assaults on one's very existence.
- Pride is not blind arrogance but a commitment to defending one's worth and contributions.
	- Acts of humility are understood as weakness.
- Creative pursuits, such as art or battle, are seen as extensions of one’s pride and individuality.
⠀
**"Accept no slight."**
*Insults or betrayals must be addressed, as unresolved grievances tarnish one’s honour.*
- Challenges, revenge, manipulation, coercion, seduction, threats, blackmail and blood feuds are all valid ways to settle disputes and disagreements.
- The longer a slight festers without resolution, the greater the loss of respect from one’s peers.
	- As such, communication is very straight-forward in the Demon World.
	- This may alternatively lead to demon's being cagey about their thoughts and/or emotions.
⠀
**"Destruction, an art."**
*Violence and destruction are not viewed as senseless acts but as expressions of creativity and dominance.*
- Battle is a performance; the victor demonstrates superiority not just in strength but also in technique and artistry.
- Demons also believe destruction to be part of the eternal cycle– strongly represented by their constant defense against lessers and ferals at the walls.
- Architecture in the Demon World reflects this philosophy, often blending brutal functionality with aesthetic beauty.
⠀
**"Death is destruction."**
*Death is not viewed as an end but as a violent return to mana’s eternal cycle.*
- The act of death—be it battle, execution, or decay—is considered the ultimate form of destruction, and destruction is seen as release, then creation in reincarnation.
- To die without leaving an impression (whether through battle, art, or legacy) is viewed as a failure.
- The ashes of the dead, rich with dispersed mana, are often revered. They are sometimes collected and used in rituals to strengthen mana reserves or to fertilize mana-infused soil for symbolic renewal.
- This philosophy fosters a disdain for passive deaths or those that lack impact, creating a cultural obsession with "worthy ends."
- Cowardice in death or intentional loss is considered a disgrace and moral failure.
- While demons believe in reincarnation, this does not diminish their respect for the finality and transformative power of destruction.
⠀
**"Weakness is your own."**
*Demons who fail to survive or ascend have only themselves to blame.*
- Suffering is a private matter, and failure is rarely pitied.
- Public displays of helplessness are deeply shameful, though the strong may offer aid to prove their superiority.
- This philosophy is harsher but widely respected in lower ranks.
- This philosophy is precarious for higher ranks, where pride often outweighs the cost of surviving a failure.
⠀
**Hierarchal harmony**
*The societal hierarchy is not a rigid caste but a dynamic system where strength, intelligence, and cunning dictate one’s place.*
- Respect flows upward, but protection flows downward.
- While weaker demons serve their superiors, they do so in exchange for security and resources.
- Conflicts within the hierarchy are expected, but chaos is despised.
- Challenges can be issued to whomever, by whomever, wherever, but challenges and personal vendettas should not disrupt societal function.
- Otherwise, *exile is swift and unrelenting.*

- The belief that the individualism of the demon race is preserved by their isolated environment.
- Often associated with traditionalist noble houses or anti-human factions.

--- end-column ---

**"Compassion is weakness."**

- Modern interpretations see selective mercy as a sign of wisdom and control.

--- end-multi-column


#### Religion

**No Gods, Only Greatness**
- While demons do not worship gods, the highest-ranking and most powerful demons are sometimes venerated as living embodiments of strength and mana.
- The [[Royal House|royal family]] may be viewed as the ultimate expression of mana's potential.
- Nobles and warriors who demonstrate exceptional skill or power may inspire cult-like reverence among lower-ranking demons.

**Mana as Divinity**
- Mana is regarded as the closest equivalent to a celestial force. It is eternal, omnipresent, and the source of all life and strength in the Demon World.
- Demons believe mana is both a gift and a responsibility, something to be wielded with respect and purpose.
- Rituals often center on mana's flow, honoring its presence in the land, the self, and the cosmos.

**The Eternalistic Truth**
- The eternal nature of the Demon World reinforces a sense of awe and respect for the unbroken cycles of creation, destruction, and reincarnation.
- Rituals and ceremonies acknowledge the infinite wastelands and underground as sacred spaces representing eternity.
- Death is seen as a sacred transition, returning mana to the world and continuing the eternal cycle.

--- start-multi-column: Rituals
```column-settings

number of columns: 2
column width: [40%, 40%, 10%]
```

**Mana Renewal Ceremonies**
- Performed when a demon dies and dispels into ash and mana, to honour the return of their essence to the Demon World.
- These rituals are overseen by demons from **Areas 1 and 2**, and in extremely special cases, the [[Royal House]].
- Ashes of the deceased are scattered into the air.
- These ceremonies are quiet, and the attendance of nobles in their best attire is a symbol of recognition for the deceased.
⠀
**Combat as Worship**
- Ritual combat is used to resolve disputes and prove worth.
- Challenges made ad repente often command a large street audience.
- Challenges to nobles, especially High Houses and the Royal House, are more formal, and always take place in **Area 6** to prevent city damage from high mana output.
- *Proof of valour or strength is required to challenge the High Houses or Royal Family,* but members of the High House may accept informal challenges if approached directly.
- Challenges are not always safe, but death in challenge is seen as a high honour.
- *Challenges cannot be made on behalf of another person.*
⠀
**Blessed Feasts**
- The emergence of mana auroras and manastorms close to the city is cause for great celebration afte they pass.
- These celebrations involve feasting, offerings to mana springs, festivals, markets, and parades.
- Nobody parties harder than demons.

--- end-column ---

**Oath Wayfaring**
- A traditional rite to inaugurate new lords and ladies of the High Houses.
- To earn their title, they must pilgrimage to large and ancient mana wells, geode pockets, or other natural wonders of the Demon World, which produce only the most lustrous of mana ores.
- They must return with a lustrous geode that will embellish their weapon of choice, a gift from the King.
- A ceremony will then be held to take their oath, reciting the Ten Virtues. They are then officially granted their weapon and named Lord or Lady.
- There has been no handover of the royal crown in centuries, so the ritual involved in the inauguration of the [[Royal House|royal family]] has somewhat faded into obscurity.
⠀
**Challenge Day**
- On the birthdays of Lords, Ladies, and acting members of the royal family, they are open to receiving *challenges from anyone, even children.*
- This is combat as worship, and failure for a Lord, Lady or member of the royal family to be present in the Demon World on this day is grounds for stripping title.
- *Challenges can be made for any purpose*– to absolve a crime, or as a challenge for authority, succession, possession, debt, etcetera. They can even be made on grounds of death.
- *A challenger only bears right to one challenge to the receiving party on this day.*

## Law, Politics & the Judicial System

### Structure 

> [!On Question of Laws in the Demon World]
> 		
> "For my brief time in the otherworld, I am often asked if demons are as unruly and violent as they seem. It is a difficult question to answer, because many of them appear rather civil. t is a challenging question to answer, for while they often appear quite civil, their world operates on rules unlike any other. From what I observed, many demons have little time interest in entertaining humans as no more than a resource or novelty. Their lives are consumed by a relentless drive to prove themselves. My tour guide was the patrolman who had found me after I slipped through the network. I was bound for Area 4, in need of transportation back to the human realm, and what I found there was as interesting as it was stomach-churning.
>		
>At one point, we passed a covered cart trundling down the street. The faint, metallic tang in the air was unmistakable, even to me. My pulse quickened as a dreadful possibility came to mind, though the patrolman beside me showed no sign of concern. I hesitated, my gaze lingering on the cart as it turned down the gold-flecked road.
>The patrolman beside me, catching my gaze, smirked. 'Don’t stare too hard,' he said lightly. 'You might end up in there yourself.'
>Horrified, or morbidly intrigued, I queried, tentatively, the contents.
>He chuckled. Chilling. 'Just cargo, nothing you’d want to be part of.' When he saw my pallor, he slapped my shoulder warmly, 'Relax. You’re with me, aren’t you?'
>Unable to suppress my unease, I carefully asked about laws in the Demon World.
>'Laws?' he repeated, tone laced with amusement, 'Like rules? Yeah, we’ve got those, I guess. But it’s mostly just stuff nobody cares about. Unless you're talking about the Ten Virtues, those are different. But  it’s not like the bigwigs are around to enforce anything these days... and there's no point stopping them. If they're weak enough to get caught, that's their problem. And if the nobles aren't diligent enough to catch them, then, well. That's theirs.' 
>		
>He dismissed me like water off metal, leaving me to wrestle my own thoughts.
>I couldn't believe his nonchalance, but I was more so shocked by the absolute obviousness of the cart's conduct. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised by the demon race's ubiquitous opinion of illegal activities– I believe this is another symptom of the race's inherent arrogance. To disguise an act is to admit weakness, and in this world, the strong have no reason to hide. The weak lose to the strong, and so the strong cannot be apprehended by the weak.
>		
>As we walked on, I could not shake the dissonance. Bonds here were forged not in kindness but in survival, some form of double-standard rivalry. A paradoxical society that thrived on hierarchal unity and yet ruthless individualism. It was both awe-inspiring and deeply unsettling, and what disturbed me most was my capacity to so easily understand it."
>		
> *- 'Traveller's Diary vol.III: Realms of the Strange', Leos Vincent V-0803

##### Royal Decree
- The word of the [[Royal House]] is absolute.
- Demons see little point in challenging the royal decree, as the strength of the royal family is unmatched, even by the highest-ranking High House, [[House Lagusa]].
- The strength of the royal family, particularly the reigning Demon King, ensures compliance. Even the High Houses, including the most influential, cannot openly defy commands.

##### High Court
- Composed of representatives from the High Houses, and in exceptional cases, also the King.
- Deals with disputes among nobility, interworld policy violations, or matters threatening the Demon World’s stability.
- The High Court is notorious for its inefficiency, as many Lords and Ladies are often away on interworld missions or personal pursuits.
    - This leaves cases delayed or mishandled, leading to unrest in lower districts.
- Cases in the High Court often rely on displays of strength, combat trials, or mana demonstrations to determine rulings.

##### Military Tribunal
- Oversees offenses committed by military personnel and enforcers.
- Focuses on desertion, treason, and abuse of authority.
- Punishments include demotion, exile, or public execution.

##### Enforcement
- Lower districts rely on local enforcers and militia to handle common crimes like theft, assault, and smuggling.
- Punishments include temporary imprisonment, exile to **Area 7**, or forced labour in the mines of **Area 6**.

### Punishments
- The Demon World takes little mercy, but in exchange, suffers an inability to address prominent crime.

**Public Exile**
- One of the most feared punishments, exile involves being cast out into **Area 7** or beyond.
- It is not feared for its brutality, but rather the aspect of public humiliation.
- Exiled demons publicly have their *wings clipped* and *mana recesses sealed* before being thrown out of the city.
- Only the thrifty can truly survive, doomed to turn feral.

**Public Execution**
- Used for treason, rebellion, or crimes against the crown.
- Executions are ceremonial, with the offender’s mana dispersal symbolizing their return to the Demon World.
- Spectators view these events as both a warning and spectacle.

**Trial by Combat**
- Reserved for disputes or challenges to authority, where strength determines justice.
- Criminals may also propose trial by combat to escape sentencing, at the cost of a *greater sentence should they lose.*
	- As such, criminals are allowed to *choose their opponents from a selection of High House representatives.* Cheating is seen as a viable strategy.
	- Some crimes are orchestrated purely to grant challenge rights against the High Houses, which are normally unobtainable for lower-ranking demons.
- Combat is to the death or until surrender, with the victor’s claim upheld.
- Death during a combat trial is seen as an honourable resolution.

**Mana Sealing**
- For crimes involving mana misuse or illegal mana practices, the offender’s mana recesses are sealed, rendering them powerless.
- Often used as a precursor to exile or servitude, as mana-sealed demons cannot defend themselves effectively.

**Forced Labour**
- Common punishment for resource-related crimes.
- Offenders are sent to the mines of **Area 6**, where they extract mana geodes under harsh conditions.

### Laws

##### Interworld Trade Laws
