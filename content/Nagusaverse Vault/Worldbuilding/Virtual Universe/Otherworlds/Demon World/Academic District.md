### Area 3: Academic District
---
#### Overview
- *Sparse schools and engineering.*
- A district of "technicians," undervalued compared to the martial or trade districts.
- The smallest ring.
- Caters to education, research, and the *development of engineering and architectural advancements.
- *There is no medical research in the Demon World.*
- Its contributions are often taken for granted, despite their importance to the Demon World’s survival.

- The home of mana-related advancements, including efficiency research and support against natural disasters and for the heavy mana output of demon society.
- Architects are responsible for the layout and expansion of the city’s concentric rings. Many architects are studious and eclectic, channeling their demonic fervor into their jobs instead of violence.
	- As such, their innovations aren't very thematic, and tend to pull from a variety of cultures– Japan the most popular among them.
- Schools provide young demons with tion on *mana manipulation, history, and demon survival,* and usually one human language of their choice.
	- Higher institutions focus on weapon-crafting, mana infrastructure, engineering, architecture, and interworld studies and lingual studies.
	- Archives support the records of Demon World history.
		- Demons place little value on history, so there are only one or two in the entire ring.
