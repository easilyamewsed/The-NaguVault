###### The High Houses

- The High Houses are the *elite nobility*, exhibiting deep mana reserves, strength and combat prowess, and close ties with the royal family. They are comprised of the *family head– the Lord or Lady– and their kin.*
	- The head of each house holds their position by *virtue of strength*.
	- They wield authority over lower districts, and largely act as commanders of military forces.
	- Few in number, they are usually sent on solo missions by royal order, often to other worlds to apprehend high-profile and extremely dangerous or disruptive Demon World criminals.
	- Lords and Ladies also act as *commanders* in times of dire combat.
	- Lords and Ladies may act as *advisors, attendants or retainers* to the royal family.
	- Frequently undertake high-stakes missions involving *otherworldly diplomacy and threat suppression*.

- *Intense competition exists both between houses and within families*, as successors are often determined through combat or displays of power.
- Political scheming is rampant, with families vying for resources, influence, and proximity to the royal family.

> [!A High House Lord, Merely a Boy]

> "During my unplanned stay, I encountered a young man in noble garb, his demeanor surprisingly approachable for a demon of his rank. He offered me a mana cache in exchange for the strawberries I had stashed in my pack. I gave them to him for free, as I cannot use a mana cache. He was delighted by the fact the gift was free. I asked if there was some form of ritual involved, but he merely said it was 'no big deal, he just really likes strawberries', popped one in his mouth, and sauntered off. At the time, I thought him no more than a wealthy eccentric with a good sense of smell.
> 		
> A bystander froze mid-step, their eyes wide with shock, before cautiously approaching me and whispering in hushed tones. Only then did I learn I had spoken to Commander Aleksandre Lagusa, Lord of the most influential High House! Renowned for his cunning in battle and critical role during the Demon-Human Interworld War, I was flabbergasted. For what purpose was the Demon King's Watchdog gallivanting about in the outer rings? That such a notorious figure would bargain for strawberries... I will surely remember it for the rest of my days.
> 		
>I could not help but be jealous of his youth, despite his minimum sixty years of life. And I had to wonder– it was thanks to that boy that peace was achieved between the human and demon realms. But looking so young, I was struck by the fact he surely could not have done it alone. If I recall, there are faint records of a human soldier, whose name is lost to time. That human was shunned for treason and executed, though we are not taught why his death brought an end to the war.

>Recalling Lord Lagusa, I cannot help think of that nameless young man."
