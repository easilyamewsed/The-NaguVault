- The third-largest area ring.
- The command center for all militant operations in the Demon World.
- Provides ongoing military training, combat preparation, and *mana control education* to its residents, which *overseen by the High Houses*.

- Resources and training often emphasize internal threats, meaning some residents are less experienced in dealing with the unique challenges of other dimensions compared to those in **Area 1**.
