##### About




---
##### Residents 

###### Legal Traders
- [[Mana Geode|Mana geodes]] are mined and accepted by the royal family, in exchange for resources and facilities in daily life. They are then issued for processing, refined into weaponry for trade or into mana caches.
- Weapons and ores are exported to other worlds.
	- Weapons are traded to the [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Realm Relations|Ouma Kingdom]] due to the high demand for specialist, anti-entity weapons.
	- The Demon World also retains strong relations with [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Realm Relations|Hell]], to supplement their perpetual war. They may also have a kinship in having their worlds constantly confused with each other.
	- Ores from the Demon World are extremely beautiful and unique in their excellent quality, making them valuable trade to any other world, including the human one.
	- *Ores, jewels, jewellery, etc. make up the majority of the Demon World's trade commerce.*
- Due to the *illegalisation of human trafficking and predation after the [[Demon-Human Interworld War]]*, human food, trinkets, and artifacts are imported to the Demon World to supplement *nutrition* as substitute, or for their novelty.

##### Points of Interest

###### Red Market
-  The **Red Market** flourishes due to the deeply ingrained demon perspective on humanity.
	- *For many demons, humans are still seen as inferior or as resources*, a relic of ancient predation that persists despite modern agreements outlawing such practices.
	- Human predation is *looked down upon by most of higher standing*, but there are many nobles in the High Houses who are hypocrites and supremacists.
		- [[Vampire|Vampires]] and [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Purebloods|purebloods]] are especially prone to feelings of supremacy.
- **Area 4** is notorious for underground trafficking networks.
	- The illegal merchants of the Red Market are *in the business of keeping their race alive*.
		- *Demons require essence-like energy for survival, often substituting human-derived products* when other options are unavailable. This creates a constant demand for illicit goods.
		- Red Market merchants deal in _essence-based commodities_ like blood, mana-infused artifacts, and even human captives.
	- [[Mana Cache|Mana caches]] are forged from a high number of mana geodes, and crafting them is equally accessible as it is illegal.
		- They circulate widely, *allowing weaker demons to falsely amplify their power, often creating facades of higher rank, wealth, or authority*.
	- Counterfeit mana geodes and enchanted items are abundant, used to deceive buyers or bypass Demon World regulations.
- Demon authorities are *primarily focused on interworld conflicts or feral outbreaks, leaving domestic illegal activities unchecked*.
- The disdain for humans discourages stringent policing of human-related black market trade.
