### Area 5: Commoner's District
---
#### Overview
- *Families, workers, daring travelers, and inns.*
- The most populous ring of the Demon World city, housing the *majority of the demon population*.
- The architecture here is utilitarian and practical, reflecting the district’s focus on function over luxury.
- Has the lowest concentration of mana-based enhancements, as *the widening radius of area circles and lower individual mana potential decreases the need for mana checks and management.*
-  Artisans creating tools, clothing, and equipment needed for both domestic life and military operations also may live in this area.

- Local markets bustle with activity, featuring basic goods and occasional unique items brought by non-demon travelers.
- Inns often double as informal trading hubs where demons and travelers barter for supplies, information, and artifacts.
- Inns cater to non-demon visitors brave enough to enter the Demon World, offering lodging and basic amenities.
	- Tend to be run by shrewd demons with the Demon World equivalent of street smarts.
	- A lot of inns are also run by [[Succubus|succubi]] and [[Incubus|incubi]]... these inns are dangerous.
- Travelers are rare but not unheard of, often seeking knowledge, trade, or daring exploration. They are usually advised to stay within designated safe zones.

- A significant portion of commoners work as *militia* enforcers, patrolling the borders, **Area 7**, to protect it from lessers and ferals.
- The *militia* is considered a legitimate career due to the relentlessness of lessers and ferals. *Militia members* dominate the majority of labourers, and are paid in resources, amenities, and facilities by the royal family.
- The militia serves as a proving ground for commoners to demonstrate their strength, with rare opportunities for promotion into the military ranks of **Area 2**. 
- Commoners are also heavily involved in *mining operations*, an essential labour for the Demon World’s economy.
- Even in this lower-ranked district, *strength dictates status*. Those who excel in mining, trade, or militia service gain respect and, occasionally, upward mobility.
- Non-demon travelers are viewed with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. *While some demons see them as opportunities for trade or novelty, others regard them as intruders or potential prey*.
- Mining accidents and militia casualties are common due to dangerous working conditions and frequent lesser or feral demon incursions.
- *Some commoners resort to black market dealings to survive, smuggling illegal goods or participating in human trafficking schemes fueled by the lingering disdain many demons hold for humanity.*
