### Area 7: The Borderline
---
#### Overview
- *Outermost boundary of the Demon World city.*
- Where civilization meets the vast, unending expanse of the Demon Wastelands.
- Beyond the walls lies an inhospitable, uncharted voidâ€”an infinite, dark expanse teeming with mana mutations, monstrous entities.
- Exiles, condemned criminals and feral outcasts are often thrown out from here.
- The walls are *not well-maintained*, with wearying stone and unmanaged mana ruptures, likely because the demons take more pride in their offense than defense.
