- Located in [[Virtual Cities#Virtual Japan|Virtual Yokohama]], is a Chinatown that never sleeps. The lights never go off, and the city always moves.
- The deeper you go, the less it feels like a town within a city, and more like a living, breathing organism of its own.
- Tourist trap by day, underworld haven by night.
- The streets are a maze. Some alleys are too thin to put on a map.
- Unspoken rules govern the streets.
- *"Chinatown is like an anglerfish. It lures you in with neon, color, and promise. But the moment you get too comfortable, the teeth clamp down."*
- The air is always thick, like it's breathing down your neck.

## Environment

#### Physicality
- Tight streets packed with neon-lit storefronts. Markets spill into roads, restaurants burn with spice and oil, and back alleys are just as popular as the main streets.
- A fusion of old and new: Some buildings date back to the Meiji era, while others are sleek, modern facades masking crime.
- Bright and artificial lighting everywhere. Mixes into a neon haze with the abundance of red lanterns.
- Clotheslines hanging between apartments, illegal satellite dishes hidden in plain sight.
- Powerlines, unhidden. Electrical siphoning is not uncommon.
- Staff doors and basement stairwells lead to underground casinos, gambling parlours, and fight rings.
- Never quiet. The streets are always occupied, whether by ragged victims or people in suits far too pristine.
- The state and colour of the signs is your best bet at navigation. Chinatown's most well-kept bright, clean signage is suspicious enough alone. Best steer clear of places with half-dead, broken bulbs.

###### Climate & Weather
- Summers are hot and muggy, exceeding 35c (100F) peak season with high humidity.
- Springs and summers (especially during Tsuyu, June-July) alternate periods of bad weather (wind, rain, typhoons, monsoons).
- Summer nights may sometimes be cool, especially during Tsuyu.
- August is the driest, sunniest, and hottest.
- Winter is usually not too cold, and sunny days are not rare, unlike in spring and autumn, whose sunny days are interfered with by weather conditions.
- Frequent rain. Winter has the driest months, with autumn being the wettest, commanding the most amount of typhoons.
- Due to only being *4km from the sea*, it may be hit by typhoons, which can bring strong rains, heavy winds and torrential damage.
- A little windier due to ocean proximity, and sea breezes tend to be a little cooler.

### Major Locations
- Chinatown is an intricate network of streets, alleys and hidden pathways, layered over itself like a rewritten blueprint.
- The city was not planned, it grew. Businesses, stalls and underground dealings shift, forcing geography to adapt to power struggles and ownership transfers.
- The further you stray from the main streets, the harder it becomes to tell if you're going somewhere you don't want to be.
- It is not a self-contained entity, but it might as well be. Police presence is thin at best, bought out at worst, and anyone unfamiliar with the streets will quickly find themselves outnumbered, outpaced, or out of luck.
- Some roads are recognisable, while others are only properly known by regulars, born and raised... or beaten.
- The district does not answer to the city, but it also does not answer to itself. No single group or authority owns all of it, though the Fura Mafia holds the strongest grip.
- It is virtually impossible to map all of Chinatown. Too much going on.

#### Landmarks
- The De
##### Zhongzua Road
- Chinatown's main street, a long and wide boulevard where the signs burn brightest and foot traffic never stops.
- Tourist-friendly, on the surface. Expensive restaurants, bustling markets, and night vendors line the street, masking the flow of laundered money and illicit dealings.
- Safe enough for casuals, but anyone who lingers too long will see the cracks beneath the polish.
- Where the 'respectable' criminals do business; meetings in teahouses, deals done over dinner, fortunes traded in backroom gambling.

###### Points of Interest
**The Paifang**
- The gate that denotes the entrance to Chinatown.
- The experienced know it is like an anglerfish's esca.

**White Lantern Market**
- A bustling night market selling everything from counterfeit luxury goods to rare artifacts smuggled from overseas.
- The safest place for shopping, but also the easiest place for a pickpocket to find a mark.
- Some stalls double as fronts for fencing stolen goods, others deal in illegal substances disguised as herbal remedies.

##### Pai Lou District
- The oldest part of Chinatown, where historic gates, traditional architecture, and crumbling tenements blend with newer developments.
- A cultural hub on the surface, known for its temples, shrines, and age-old traditions.
- The further you go, the more the streets narrow and darken, twisting like a maze. Newcomers get lost easily, and not all of them are found.
- Rival factions and crime families once fought for control here, leaving behind scars in the form of bullet-riddled walls and burnt-out buildings. The Fura Mafia’s dominance has brought relative stability, but the tension lingers.
###### Points of Interest
**Kaisei Lock Shop**
- A locksmith establishment run by [[Kaisei]].
- The shop was handed down in five generations of Kaiseis, and is probably older than the Fura Mafia's hold on Chinatown.
- He doesn't seem to be a criminal.
- The shop has been there so long, and causes so little trouble, that the Fura Mafia likely lets its remain out of respect. (*Respect your senpai.*)
- The shop has a loft landing and is deceptively empty,
- Except for like, a desk and two shitty bar stools.

**Watarai Hibari's Apartment**
- An average apartment, a little on the smaller side. A space Hibari rents himself.
- It's probably on the second floor of someone else's shop. Likely a café.
- Filled with music albums, records, guitars, and tons of sound equipment.
- Messy with plastic bottles and containers. Lived in, warm.
- The kitchen is properly stocked.
- Lacking a little in security, but it's unexpected position probably saves him a lot of trouble.
##### Jade Corridor
###### Points of Interest
**Blue Moon Lounge**
- *Shikinagi Akira's* shisha bar, doubling as a front for information brokering.
- A luxurious, low-lit bar in blues, silvers, and purples.
- It appears to be dog-friendly, not that that's common, and has a variety of aquariums to add to the atmosphere.
- Neon tetras and siamese fighting fish are high in number.
- This shisha bar sells coffee, tea, soft drinks, and snacks as well as the usual alcohol selection. The legality of doing so? Irrelevant.
- It does not offer herbal shisha due to the harmful chemicals that can affect bystanders. Waitstaff insist customers have mocktails instead.

**Qilin Club**
- The crown jewel of Chinatown's elite vice district.
- A playground for crime lords, politicians and old-money families.
- High-stakes gambling and private auctions take place here.
- An opulent casino, with patterned, red-runner carpets, accented in gold and jade.
- Not as small as it looks on the outside, containing a food court as well as its gambling areas.
- The only way in is invitation, connection, or desperation.
- It's basement is high-ceiling, red carpet, with a stage and a podium for the auctions that occur out of sight.

##### Kōshū Road 

##### The Underground 
###### Points of Interest
**The Weapons Range**
- A place rented out by *Seraph Dazzlegarden* beneath a warehouse in the [[Chinatown#Yamashita Pier|dockyards]].
- For weapons testing and demonstration.
- Or executions.
##### Lantern Alley 
###### Points of Interest
**The Medicine-Seller's Shop**
-  The medicine store run by *Watarai Hibari*.
- A small, old place, a gift from the [[Fura Family]]. It has door beads for an entrance.
- It's not modern. Wooden shelves over glass casing, which display knick-knacks and other things.
- All medicine is over-the-counter, and the rest of the merch is miscellaneous items like trinkets.
- Although, Hibari does keep an aquarium of fish that he sometimes sells. Akira is his main buyer.

###### Points of Interest
**The Dockyard**

**Fura Family HQ**

**Fura Kanato's Penthouse**
- A penthouse on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.
- It is contemporary, with white walls and flooring to make it look spacious. The couches are plush, but the luxury is otherwise understated.
- Windows are floor-to-ceiling, but the blackout curtains are usually pulled down (for safety, but also because the height makes Kanato nervous).
- Although he spends time there, it isn't very used. It looks more untouched than it is because of the cleaners.
- Kanato does not fill the empty space with much of anything.
- Kitchen entirely unused, save for the coffee machine. Not even a frying pan.
