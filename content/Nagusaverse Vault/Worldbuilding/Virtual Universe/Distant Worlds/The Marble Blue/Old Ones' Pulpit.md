- A tall and rocky jut of stone out of the ocean, it is not difficult to spot, and is the lone landmass for miles and miles.
- There is nothing here aside from trees and flowers and sky.
- There seem to be many, many superstitions surrounding this place.

##### About

- A large, vertical, naturally-formed plateau that juts out of the ocean like the fin of a giant beast.
- It's base is tropical beach, hugging the grey and rocky stone of the mountain's face. There may be signs of encampment, before the tide inevitably washes them away.
- Small inlets create pockets in the rockface, good for taking shelter but not much else.
- To reach the top, travellers will have to ascend the stone steps that run the Pulpit's circumference. They are smooth and worn—travellers would be wise to stay close to the rockface, and do their best not to slip.
- The surface of the Pulpit is vast meadow, with spates of forest scattered about. The cooler temperatures up here support primarily pine trees. The sky stretches far above, endless and clear. It is utterly peaceful here, with calm breezes, gentle rains, and a perpetual veil of mist.
- This may be one of few locations where non-aquatic animals are common, such as mountain goats, yaks, rodents, and a multitude of small and large birds, as well as the creatures typical to the lower tropical areas.
- The meadow is dotted with many wildflowers,
	- primarily of which are the [alpine violet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_labradorica): Core groundcover of the plateau; grows low against wind in every mossy patch and grass mat. Carpets the meadow in violet haze after rain.
	- The [hairy primrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_labradorica): Favors moist depressions and puddled soil where fog condenses. Adds pink-violet highlights among the violets.
	- The [alpine bellflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campanula_alpina): Takes the cracks of boulders and the edges of rock slabs. Bells sway on wiry stems, acting as accent points.
	- The [purple gentian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentiana_purpurea): Appears in slightly deeper soil pockets, often near animal burrows or sheltered spots. Upright wine-colored trumpets—visual punctuation across the field.
	- and [the sky pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemonium_viscosum): Found only on the very crown ridges where wind strips away everything else. Tight clusters no larger than a hand. The bloom most locals would name legends after.

###### Secrets
- This plateau is the place closest to the [[Old Ones]] in the entirety of the Marble Blue.

##### Residents 

###### The People of Vervena
- These people had slower metabolisms and higher red-blood-cell counts to sustain their high-altitude way of life.
- They thrived on dense and starchy crops.
- Some were of [[Sirens|half-siren descent]], speaking Aklo and Primordial tongue as migrants from the lower world. Many came to Vervena looking to pursue the freedom of the [[Old Ones.]] 
- Other inhabitants were the odd traveller or [[Harpies|harpy]].

##### Points of Interest

###### Vervena 
- Now destroyed, it was once a small village that resided atop the *Old One's Pulpit*. Only earthworks and ancient ruins remain.
	- *Vervena* was the name of the *Old One's Pulpit* as a whole, before it became known as such.
- A modest and humble village of stone houses, stoked-fire chimneys, cattle and community. 
- The people here were kind and friendly, but lived primarily in isolation due to the excessive altitude of their island.

**Vessels**
- Carrying the beliefs of their siren parentage, the half-sirens of Vervena were migrants who heard the voices of the [[Old Ones ]]. 
- Seeking to spare the Old Ones' of their deep-sea prison and bring them the freedom of the sky, many of them would migrate to establish Vervena, where they would begin bargaining with the Old Ones: 'your power, for our bodies as vessels which are close to the sky'.
	- The ritual could not be conducted if the chosen was not of siren descent, because sirens are the closest to the Old Ones, and are the only ones that know their lineage songs. 
		- Legged half-sirens are notably rare. Most half-sirens exhibit their tailed side as the dominant gene instead.
		- There were no tailed half-sirens in Vervena, due to it being high-altitude and far from the beaches below. 
	- If the chosen was not able to sing (in Primordial or Aklo; the lullabies of Vervena) loud enough to be heard over a storm, they were deemed unsuitable by the people of Vervena as per ritual practice. Not shunned, just merely not an option for the Old Ones to take. 
- There were many successful vessels, most of which remained in conference with the Old Ones in Vervena. 
	- The successful vessels enjoyed mysterious powers, foresight, communion with a variety of deep sea creatures, and helped Vervena flourish. 
	- However, they would suffer memory problems and longer lifespans.
	- The last successful vessel was [[Hoshirube Sho]] (excluding [[Watarai Hibari#Homemade|Watarai Hibari's]] illicit selection), who was not in Vervena at the time it was destroyed.

**The Forgotten History**
- The Old Ones, selfish and yearning to fill the void of their inhuman, omniscient selves, would accept many vessels during the time Vervena existed.
- However, a part-siren boy would be born, who had a singing voice unlike any other. They wanted him terribly.
- The boy was deemed unsuitable as chosen, because his health was often poor and his lungs too weak. For many years, the Old Ones' asked and asked, and each time they would only receive 'no' for an answer.
- The Old Ones, annoyed, would leave Vervena to the whims of storm and wind.
- When the boy was 21, he would try to conduct the ritual himself to help his village. It failed, and he suffered an asthma attack. His family cursed the Old Ones in a fury.
- The Old Ones, not unlike children, raged, turning superstorms upon Vervena and ravaging it.
- In their efforts to take the boy—what they believed as rightfully theirs, as he was of siren blood; their blood!—the ocean would crest higher and higher, until a wave leapt from the ocean and tore Vervena asunder.
- The boy is stolen into the sea, but the Old Ones realised nothing remained of his homeland, and the civilisation they themselves had found companionship in. But they had the boy.
- In a facsimile of human guilt, they granted the boy an endless dream, and took him into their arms as stasis, as he sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
- They want love, not possession. So for apology, they would search the ocean's space and time for the boy's perfect friend, emulating the innocent childhoods the Old Ones observed while Vervena thrived. 
- They search for someone far in the future. They search for someone who will not be born in this time, who may never be born, for the system has fated him to die before birth. Upon finding the one—by the name of [[Fura Kanato#Homemade|Fura Kanato]]—
	- 'Our dreamer will be born to a family of pirates in the middle of strife, and he will not survive.'
	- 'Without life, he is another force that belongs to us. A mortal's time for us to mould as we see fit.'
- —They would link their chosen's dreams to him.
	- 'He is ours for our chosen to dream of. Our chosen will be safe with us for all eternity, dreaming an infinite dream of him, so our chosen will not be lonely.'
	- 'And so we will not be lonely, for our chosen will never wake.'
- Eighty years after the fall of Vervena, Fura Kanato is born and survives against all odds; his mother dies. As he ages, his dreams grow more infrequent, until he forgets Hibari altogether.
- In the absence of Kanato—born now, and no longer a thread malleable by the Old Ones—Watarai Hibari begins to suffer nightmares.
- A hundred years after the fall of Vervena, Fura Kanato is 20 and no longer dreams. A horrible dream wakes Watarai Hibari from his hundred-year slumber, and frees him from the Old Ones' stasis. 
- The Old Ones want him back.
