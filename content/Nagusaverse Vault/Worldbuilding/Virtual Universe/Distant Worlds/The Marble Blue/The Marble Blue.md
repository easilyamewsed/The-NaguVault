- A world of near-endless sea. The sailor's and pirate's ways of life are common here.
- This world may be slightly closer to the sun than the average virtual iterations of Earth.
- The history of this realm is shrouded in mystery, though it was once said the world was not all ocean.
- The settlements—few and far between—vary from highly advanced and bustling to archaic and modest.

*SYSTEM REPORT: 2434:\VirtualWorld0\TheMarbleBlue*
*[1] The Marble Blue is a [[Otherworlds#Distant Worlds|distant world]].*
*[2] The isolation (non-instantiation) of this world's code lessens the number of glitches and greatly reduces the number of interlopers.*
*[3] Without apt preparation and navigation, **human survival is difficult**.*

## Environment

#### Physicality
- If one were to hold the globe of this world up to the light like a marble, they would surely discover it to be almost entirely blue, with very few flecks of land to break up the monotony of ocean.

###### Climate & Weather
- The oceans of this world are deep; their cooling effects balance the heat of the sun and permit a tropical climate.
- Very little ice is in any areas of the planet, if at all.
- What land is exposed is primarily green and lush with life, or barren desert.
- With less land to block winds and excessive moisture evaporating into the atmosphere, the Marble Blue experiences storms more frequently, with a higher baseline for storm severity.
	- The Marble Blue experiences a great number of superstorms (tropical cyclones, outbreaks of supercells, etc.).
- Ocean currents are still moving below the surface—along with things unknown—and create striated currents, which create striated winds.
	- High winds, big storms, and constant cloud cover are all utterly normal for the Marble Blue. 


----
### Design

- A vast stretch of sea, the landmasses that make up the continents and islands of the Marble Blue are peppered all over the globe.
- They vary in size, height, population, and development, and grow, travel and trade primarily through sea routes.
- Due to the heavy reliance on sea routes, *piracy* is extraordinarily common, and exists as a way of life for many criminals.
	- Because of the high number of pirates, several pirate havens exist across the map of the Marble Blue.
	- Pirates with wealth may sit at the top of some of these havens, ruling them as feral cities outside the government's control.
