### The Orchards 
---
#### Overview
- Stretching far beyond [[WIndsteep|Windsteep's]] port and township, the orchards are a sea of green and gold, interrupted only by crooked irrigation ditches and the skeletons of old windmills.
- In a world where land is precious, Windsteep’s orchards are the breadbasket—and the crown jewel—of the archipelago's citrus economy.
- Their fruit ships to every corner of [[The Marble Blue]]; perfect oranges, mandarins, bitter lemons, bananas fat as a child's fist, even strawberries grown in elaborate hothouses.
- The [[Fura Family|Fura Pirates']] monopoly means every peel, pip, and blossom is counted and taxed. Nothing leaves the island without their mark.

##### About




---
##### Residents
###### Orchardists
- Generations of workers bound to the soil by debt, threat, or inheritance.
- Each family claims a small plot, but the yield belongs to the Fura.
- Eldest workers know the secret paths and can vanish at a moment’s notice if a raid hits.
- Children aid the family business as fruit-pickers, squirrel-chasers, or runners between the sheds.

###### Guards 
- Uniformed enforcers, often ex-pirates or those working off a sentence.
- Patrol the fields day and night. Known for their bright sashes, dogs, and the polished pistols at their hips.
- Trusted by no one, not even the Fura. Their word is law in the orchard at night.

##### Points of Interest

###### Vertical Orchards 
- Ingenious scaffolding of iron and driftwood—citrus trees grown in stacked tiers to maximize limited land.
- The oldest vertical blocks are rumored to house secret meeting rooms, or be honeycombed with tunnels used by smugglers and runaways.
- At sunrise, the mists catch on the scaffold, turning the whole orchard into a hanging garden of gold.

###### Orchard Fields 
- The heart of the operation: wide, flat expanses of trees divided by irrigation ditches.
- Shacks for tools, workers’ barracks, and Fura watchtowers dot the fields.
- In the middle of each block stands a shrine to the 'Fruit Spirits'—a superstition, but even the Fura leave offerings during the first harvest.
