### The Greenhouse
---
#### Overview
- At the very end of the main road of [[Windsteep]] lies the Greenhouse, owned by the [[Fura Family|Fura Pirates]].
- Aboveground, a dazzling glasshouse of wrought iron and hand-blown panels, humid and fragrant year-round.
- A fernery; a tropical botanical garden, and the jewel of the island.
- Beneath its tiled floors and trickling fountains lies the true purpose: a subterranean auction hall, velvet-lined and lantern-lit. A narrow stream divides audience from stage.
- The auction is held once every two weeks.

##### About




---
##### ~~Residents~~ Clientele

###### Gardeners
- Attendants of the Fernery—pleasant, soft-spoken folk paid more than most [[Windsteep]] dockworkers ever dream of.
- Uniforms of linen smocks, waxed boots, sun hats with trailing ribbons.
- All are expert horticulturalists, proud of their perfect rows and rare cultivars.
- They clock off at sunset. None remain after dark.

###### Curators
- Masked attendants and wardens of the lower level.
- Move silently; their uniforms resemble the gardeners’, but the masks are bone-white porcelain, expressionless.
- Their duties: cataloguing, transport, discipline, and maintaining the security and secrecy of the Auction Hall.
- Nearly all are Fura affiliates or owe debts too deep to escape.
- Outsiders say the Curators 'prune both roses and thorns.'

###### Smugglers
- The true engine of the Auction Hall—procurers, wranglers, and sellers of stock.
- They range from grizzled pirates and opportunist thieves to disaffected nobles with debts to settle.
- Names and faces change constantly; all dealings are anonymous.
- Veteran smugglers receive private holding rooms and certain “perks”—but boastfulness is a death sentence.
- Those who let their tongues wag end up in cages beside their cargo, or vanish on the return journey.

###### Private Collectors & Scholars (Buyers)
- The privileged few, arriving by invitation, ticket, or knowledge of the ever-changing password.
- Many arrive masked or veiled, titles and names scrubbed from the records.
- Some are wealthy nobles, some government officials, some “scientists” seeking rare biology—none are there by accident.

###### Specimens
- The heart of the Hall—living beings “curated” as if they were rare orchids or prize beasts.
- Labeled, catalogued, and prettied for auction: hair combed, wounds cleaned, assigned false names and false histories.
- Valued for beauty, rarity, utility, or spectacle.
- At a buyer’s request, some are forced to perform in 'shows'—these are rumored to range from ritual combats to public humiliation, bloodletting, or acts best left unspoken.
- Few ever return to the surface, but their absence is always felt.

##### Points of Interest

###### The Fernery 
- A public glasshouse filled with tropical flora and citrus trees. The humidity and scent are near-intoxicating.
- A reflecting pool lies at the center, under which runs the hidden lift to the lower halls.
- The 'caretakers' are all armed, though tourists take their tools for gardening shears.
- Rumour says if you press your ear to the tile by the north fountain, you can hear whispers beneath the surface.

###### The Auction Hall 
- Accessible only by invitation and sealed behind four sets of locks and loyal guards.
- The hall is circular, its walls carved from volcanic rock and lined with velvet drapery.
- Water from the upper pools trickles through grates, masking the sound of voices.
- Seating consists of twelve balcony boxes, each hidden behind darkened glass. No one ever sees the other bidders.
- The stream that separates stage from audience carries runoff from the Fernery above—filtered water mixed with the scent of crushed petals and disinfectant.
- Every auction begins in silence, punctuated only by the turn of a crank that raises the first cage from below.
