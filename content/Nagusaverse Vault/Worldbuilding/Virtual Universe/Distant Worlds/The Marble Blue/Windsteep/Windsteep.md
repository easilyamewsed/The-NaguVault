- A pirate haven under the thumb of the [[Fura Family|Fura Pirates]]. Their pinwheel mark brands most shops, taverns, restaurants, and whatever else.
- After exiting the main port, the orchards spread out over the vast majority of the land, thriving.

	- And... other goods, if one is searching.
- *'It's a human-meat pie with a citrus glaze.'*
