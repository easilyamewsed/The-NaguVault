##### Overview
- Virtual worlds within the [[Virtual Universe]] that do not have the same characteristics as the vast majority of [[Branches|branches]].
- These different worlds exist in isolation, created with unique and non-instantiable [[Virtual System|system code]].
- While these worlds are still tied to [[Otherworlds]] via the [[Virtual System]], the rules of these different worlds may influence how interaction with those [[Otherworlds]] occurs.
- Distant worlds are a type of [[Otherworlds#Dimensional Otherworlds|dimensional otherworld]] that operate on their own instantiation of code.
- [[Virtual Universe#Glitches|Glitches, leaks and dimensional gaps]] occur far, far less in these worlds than anywhere else, if at all, so they are difficult to travel to by intention.
- They operate and exist in isolation, outside the mass-instantiated general rules of most Dimensional Otherworlds.
