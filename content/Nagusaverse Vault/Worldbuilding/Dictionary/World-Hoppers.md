#### World-Hopping Leos Vincents

- [[Leos Vincent]]s who have decided to take their science to the next level, and subsequently utilises loopholes and glitches in the [[Virtual System]].
- Not a system anomaly. Just a very smart guy in every possible worldline.
- The system does not see him as a threat or anomaly, because he's not actively corrupting data, just interacting with it in unintended ways.
	- Leoses do not break things, just bend them. Otherwise the system flags them as [[System Compound#Residents|infractors]].
- Their method of inter-world travel is unreliable at best, but if it works, it works. Some may merely be [[Virtual Universe#Dimensional Gaps|gap]]-hunters.
- Generally, they try to avoid misdemeanours and worldline disruption, but anything goes in the pursuit of science.
- Fortunately, the system cares little for dead worlds. As such, the Leoses have become integral to the resurrection of glitched and corrupted worldlines. 

##### LIV-WIN
*(a.k.a: Leos Vincent Wi-Fi Network)*
###### Overview 
Once known as the *Leos Vincent Network of Accidental World-Hoppers*, LIV-WIN acts as what is basically a decentralised, self-regulating, online chaos society built on the collective stupidity of infinite Leoses who keep losing their goddamn notes.

- A network accessible exclusively by [[Leos Vincent|Leos Vincents]]. 
- Connects Leos instances across infinite worldlines.
- It's like having the ultimate internet highway for communication across the entirety of the [[Virtual System]]... or as far as discovered, anyway.
- Leos instances can communicate across [[Branches|worldlines]] without even having to be in the same one.
- **Passwords change every two hours because Leos can never trust anyone but himself.**
- **Chatrooms are heavily encrypted to protect the integrity of the [[Virtual System]]. And also Leos.**

###### How It Works
- The number of world-hopping Leoses was already high when the idea of LIV-WIN was first conceived.
- Once a Leos connects to LIV-WIN, their [[Branches#Branch ID|branch ID]] becomes inextricably tied to their LIV-WIN identity. LIV-WIN tracks the location of Leos via this [[Branches#Branch ID|branch ID]], and utilises them as a *server anchor* to help better connect worldlines across long distances.
- LIV-WIN is accessible through modifications of modern devices, a complex mix of rituals and magic, and other innumerable, creatively designed means befitting a worldline's possibilities.
