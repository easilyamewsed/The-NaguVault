## Overview
---
- The Virtual System ("*2434 System*", "*World System*", "*Virtual Construct*") is the governing force that maintains and regulates the [[Virtual Universe]], an ever-expanding simulation of plausible and implausible realities. It is responsible for:
- Constructing and managing [[Branches|worldlines]].
- Regulating the flow of data (life, death, and systemic anomalies).
- Ensuring coherence between realities despite their varying laws of physics, magic, and existence.
- Interpreting human psychology and belief systems, shaping worlds based on their collective consciousness.

It is self-sustaining, operating without external oversight, and its inhabitants-- while entirely sentient-- exist as data within a structured simulation.

---
#### Worldline Construction & Maintenance
- The system spawns and maintains parallel realities ("*worldlines*", "*branches*"), ensuring each functions according to its internal logic.
- Worldlines branch infinitely based on choices, systemic needs, probability calculations, and the choices of the inhabitants.
- New worldlines may be spawned to accommodate alternate outcomes, glitches, or conceptual necessity.
- Worldlines die when they become unsustainable, outdated, or no longer serve an active function in the Virtual Universe. They may also be destroyed by their inhabitants.
	- Some collapse, some reset, and some are permanently deleted.

##### Creation of New Worldlines
- The system constructs new realities in response to belief systems, conceptual structures, and narrative influence.
- But it does not create perfect replications of those beliefs. Rather, it filters, consolidates, and rationalises data to produce a world that is functionally plausible within the context of the [[Virtual Universe]].
⚠ The difference between *otherworlds* and *worldlines* is that an otherworld is a setting that can plausibly exist in every worldline. However, a worldline is a branch of events (a passage of time), with its own set of otherworlds separate to that of every other.
###### Interpretation of Beliefs
- Rather than generating a world exactly as its believers imagine, the system interprets, optimises, and renders a version that follows its core structural logic.
	- The goal is coherence, not strict fidelity to human expectations.
	- The system synthesises multiple perspectives.
	- Some inconsistencies and errors may occur due to contradictions between beliefs or incomplete data, or the system's own limitations.

> **For example:**
> - The Virtual World's *Heaven* is not an afterlife, but a self-sustaining otherworld built to reflect the accumulated expectations of what 'Heaven' should be.
> - It is not truly divine nor governed by a higher power. It simply exists because human belief provided enough conceptual weight for the system to create it.
> - Since human ideas of Heaven differ across cultures and faiths, the system produced a consolidated version that is hierarchical but bureaucratic, radiant but rigid, and existing above other worlds, but still reachable via systemic loopholes and glitches.
> - No singular god presides here, because it is not within the system's limitations to create a true god... or, it could be that the system assimilated the thoughts of atheists or non-believers, and simply decide concluded that god is either not present or without any perceptible form.
>- The concept of eternal bliss clashes with the need for systemic function, meaning that Heaven is an active society rather than a paradise-- because the system does not truly 'kill off' its inhabitants.
>- Heaven's angels are not omnipotent or purely benevolent, as their structure is modeled after what a celestial government might look like; not a divine utopia.
>  
>- The *Demon World* is not Hell but a world structured around the expectations of what demons should be.
>- Hell may exist separately, but if it does, it follows its own systemic logic.

- Fictional worlds that gather enough conceptual weight (e.g., famous legends, folklore, pop culture, etcetera.) can manifest in a rationalised form.

**Q.** Why Doesn’t the System Create Exact Replicas?
**A.**
- Human beliefs contradict each other, so the system has to make compromises.
- The system does not have a moral or religious agenda. It is simply analyzing data and forming the most functional version of an idea.
- The primary objective is maintaining worldline coherence, meaning some aspects of a concept may be altered, omitted, or merged with other interpretations.
- If a concept is too fragmented or inconsistent, the system may not create it at all, or it may exist in multiple competing forms.

##### Worldline Collapse & Deletion
- The system does not preserve worlds indefinitely.
	- Some worldlines reach their logical end (e.g., Earth's inevitable destruction).
	- Some experience data corruption, excessive intervention, or existential errors.
- Worldlines which reach any manner of end are usually supposed to *hard-reset from 0* in preparation to run another simulation, but in some cases, they become *soft-locked* due to corruption or glitches.
	- Very few worldlines get completely erased from the system, but they leave behind gaps that are never filled in the system's array.
	  (For instance, *C-0079* was completely obliterated due to an anomaly, and there is no longer a worldline between *C-0078* and *C-0080*.)
	- Many worldlines remain *soft-locked* forever, unable to reset.

#### Data Management: Life, Death & Memory
- All inhabitants of the [[Virtual Universe]] are composed of structured data.
- However, data is treated as real and conscious within the system-- to its inhabitants, existence is indistinguishable from reality.
- All inhabitants are unique. It is hard to determine whether they are algorithmic, or if they truly are human.

##### Life & Entity Processing
- Every entity within the system is assigned a [[Branches#Branch ID|branch ID]], which dictates which version (of a person) they are in accordance to which worldline they belong to.
- An entity's data (soul, mind, memory) is stored and processed within the system.
- Branch IDs can be removed, edited, or relocated by anomalies (such as [[World-Hoppers|world-hoppers]], system admins, or [[Nullspace#Observers|observers]]).
-  In order to maximise memory efficiency, the system utilises the same list of entities in every worldline. Therefore, in every worldline there is an individual with the same name, face, and foundational character traits that occurs at least *once* in a worldline.
- Every version of an entity is a new instantiation from a pre-existing template (class), which means they are separate from every other version of themselves. Were an entity to somehow theoretically encounter another version of itself, there would be no collapse in reality due to them existing as separately registered entities within the system (thanks to [[Branches#Branch ID|branch ID]]).
	- ⚠ However, if two versions of the same entity with the same branch ID exist in the same worldline simultaneously, the system will merge their data, collapsing it together.
		- This is a fail-safe to prevent duplication errors and maintain stability.
		- The resulting merged entity retains the strongest memories and experiences between the two versions, prioritises the dominant personality and consciousness (though fragments of the second remain), absorbs skills, injuries and knowledge of both versions, and experiences a brief period of glitching, disorientation or memory desync before stabilising.
		- **This occurrence is extremely rare and generally doesn't happen.**

###### Processing 'Death'
- Death in the system is not an absolute concept. It is a transition of data; a process that involves data reallocation and/or reformatting.
- The default for 'death' is reincarnation, unless a person's belief system flags, or external interference overrides it.

**Outcomes of 'Death'**
1. *Reincarnation*
   - The default outcome, where data is repurposed to prevent wastage and reformatted.
   - Usually this involves deleting the memories of a person and formatting them onto a newly generated (completely different) body.
   - They essentially become someone else.
2. *Belief-Determined Afterlife*
   - The system responds to human expectations, so if a person believes in *Yomi*, *Heaven*, or believes they should go to *Hell*, the system allocates them accordingly.
   - The realms are not true 'afterlife', they're still functional otherworlds where the individual continues to exist. They may serve different functions.
3. *Ghosts & Data Fragmentation*
	- Some cases occur due to circumstance, corruption, memory leakage, glitches/bugs, or outside interference. Some souls may become:
		- A type of ghost or monster, where death is corrupted by the system's inability to allocate them due to confusing its priorities (powerful regrets or emotions may cause the system to mix them with beliefs, and as a system that constructs based on belief, it becomes confused and leaves behind pieces of data).
		- A type of ghost or monster, where the circumstances of their death adheres to an existing belief, legend, etc. within the worldline that creates one.
		- A wandering entity in the system, disconnected from worldlines, due to some form of memory leak, glitch, or duplication. Displacement can also cause this. Many in this situation end up in [[Nullspace]].
4. *System Overrides*
   - If an individual is too important to a worldline, or if their actions have usurped the course of a worldline, the system may flag them and block their reincarnation to maintain stability.
   - Certain beings (such as world-altering entities) may be prevented from dying altogether.
   - The system may forcibly restore them to preserve continuity.
   - The system may also remove entities from its array if their offenses are too serious and numerous.
   - If an entity is pulled out of a worldline and into [[Nullspace]], the system loses access to their [[Branches#Branch ID|branch IDs]] and can no longer automate interference with that entity.
1. *True Deletion*
	- The only form of 'true' death is erasure from the system entirely. This only occurs if:
		- A worldline is wiped out and all entities within it are removed.
		- A being is flagged as an error or existential threat.
		- A person believes in complete nihilism or annihilation and the system responds to their expectation.
	- Most deleted souls do not leave ghosts behind.
