## Overview
---
- A historical event that occurred sometime in the 1950s.
- Due to an excess of glitches in the [[Virtual Universe]], a number of [[Virtual Universe#Dimensional Gaps|dimensional gaps]] leading to the [[Worldbuilding/Virtual Universe/Otherworlds/Demon World/Demon World|Demon World]] began opening up in [[Virtual Earth|Virtual Japan]].
- This caused a number of [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Lesser Demons|lesser demons]] and [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Feral Demons|feral demons]] to pour through the gaps and begin wreaking havoc on human civilization.
- [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Area 4 Trade District|Predation]] of humans by certain noble demons also spiked during this time. As such, the mortality rate for demons straying into the human realm also increased.
- Believing the demons had declared war, *Japan* began responding with their own elite forces, allying with the [[Ouma Kingdom]] and forming the [[Anti-Demon Defense Force]] (ADDF).
- After the alleged kidnapping of [[Makai no Ririmu|Princess Ririmu of the Demon World]], the demons too declared war. [[Royal House|King Satan]]'s vanguard would also participate in the war, including [[House Lagusa]].
- Exacerbated by the repeated kidnapping of Demon World nobles and deaths of human officials, the war raged for *three years*.
- The war mysteriously ended on the accolades of *a Demon World noble, who was said to have stepped down after the war.*
- The *Interworlds Hostilities Cessation Treaty* (Cessation Treaty) was then established, signifying peace and [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Laws|new laws]] between the human and demons and concluding the *Demon-Human Interworld War*.

**Erased History**
- It was discovered that the targeted human officials were capturing and using demons and prisoners of war for experimentation and entertainment.
- The Demon World refuted a peace treaty, stating dishonor by the human officials' actions against demonkind. They demanded reparations befitting their culture.
- It was decided the human responsible for the murders would be executed on serial charges of repeated first-degree homicide.
- The young human—the [[Kanae|third incarnation of Kanae]]— *fled* with the help of a *noble from the Demon World*—[[Kuzuha|Aleksandre Lagusa]]— but eventually turned himself in.
- The war was ended by the *execution of the soldier whose name was erased from history, and his accomplice was exiled from the Demon World.*
