#Dictionary 
##### Overview
- Also known as *worldlines*, a *branch* refers to an existing reality containing some set of events within the [[Virtual Universe]].
- *Worldlines* possess some measure of distance between each other.
	- You can picture this like a loom with threads of a colour gradient. The string on the furthest end, which is red, is right next to a string in a very similar shade of red. However, this string is the **furthest away** from the string on the other side of the loom, which is green.
	- A red thread sits closest to another red thread — similar. But it’s furthest from the green thread on the other side — vastly different.
	- *Worldlines aren’t isolated; they exist in relation to each other, some nearer, some impossibly far.*

###### Branch ID 
- Every entity within the system is assigned a *branch ID*, which dictates which version (of a person) they are, in accordance to which worldline they belong to.
	- ie: the Leos Vincent of Branch A-2434 will have a *branch ID* of *LeosVincentA2434*.
- Without a *branch ID*, an entity cannot functionally exist.
	- Entities that lose their *branch IDs* end up in [[Nullspace]], as the system does not properly register them as an object that should exist.
	- Entities that lose their *worldlines* but still maintain their *branch IDs* also end up in [[Nullspace]].
	- The system cannot interfere with entities within [[Nullspace]], and so cannot automate any affects on their *branch IDs*.
- *Branch IDs* can be removed, edited, or relocated by anomalies (such as [[World-Hoppers|world-hoppers]], [[System Compound#Administrators|system administrators]], or [[Nullspace#Observers|observers]]).
