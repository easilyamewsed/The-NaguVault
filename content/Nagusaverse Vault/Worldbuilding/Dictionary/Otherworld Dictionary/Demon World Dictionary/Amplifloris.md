##### Overview
*Supertype:* Parasitic | *Subtype:* Obligate | *Element:* Typeless

- *A genus of plant originating in the [[Worldbuilding/Virtual Universe/Otherworlds/Demon World/Demon World|Demon World]]. They are a parasitic, pollinating flower that survives on the emotions of a host.*
- The first *amplifloris* was likely carried by a [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Lesser Demons|lesser demon]] as a product of [[Mana|mana]] coalescing into biological and/or organic mass.
- Inherently products of mana, and have [[Mana#Mana Recesses|mana recesses]] to store it.
- Its pollen, when expelled, fertilises mana-rich soils, creating more vibrant flora.

----
##### Habitat
- The *amplifloris* originates from the [[Worldbuilding/Virtual Universe/Otherworlds/Demon World/Demon World|Demon World]], as a parasitic growth on organic and/or biological [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Lesser Demons|lesser demon]].
- Spreads by infecting packs of lesser demons, using their interactions and migrations to expand its reach.
- Rare outside the Demon World due to the higher mana density required to sustain its lifecycle.

```

###### Seeding & Infection
- The flowerâ€™s [[Mana#Mana Recesses|mana recesses]] detect, but do not absorb, [[Mana#Ambient Mana|ambient mana]].
- Uses this detection to locate [[Mana#Emotional Currents|emotional currents]] (species-dependent).
- The flower's pollen, which is tiny and carries the seed, senses heightened emotional energy through this detection, and is drawn toward a host.
	- The flower pursues its required emotional currents (species-dependent).
- After pollen is inhaled, the seed anchors inside the host's body.
	- The respiratory system offers safety, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and proximity to emotional stimuli.

###### Growth
- Once inside the lungs, exposed to oxygen and mana currents, the seed activates.
- As it seeds inside the host, it is not visually detectable from the outside exempting symptoms.
- The flower's mana recesses align with the host's [[Mana#Mana Signature|mana signature]] via [[Mana#Mana Binding|mana binding]].
- Once aligned, the signature is *locked,* allowing the flower to:
	- Parse emotional currents as mana for nutrients.
	- Amplify the emotional currents using its own mana, creating a feedback loop.

- In the majority of cases (especially in non-demon species), *binding* fails and the seed dies, evaporating.
- The plant's maturation is relatively slow, taking a minimum of a month to bear buds.

--- end-column --- 

###### Maturation
- The plant follows a standard growth cycle as it feeds. Its stems and buds will continue to grow inside the lungs.

- Prolonged parasitism can cause the *amplifloris* to meld tightly with the host's emotions.
	- The mana it produces becomes interwoven with the *producers* of the *bound emotion*.
	- The mana, parsed from emotional currents, inherently contains information or fragments of the host.
	- The longer the plant feeds on these currents, the more it latches onto the *producers* of said currents through *binding*.
		- These *producers* are generally memories or information about people, places, events, choices, etc.
		- In order to improve nutrients, the *amplifloris* symptomatically learns the relation of the *producers* to their *emotional currents*, becoming inevitably *bound* to the *producers* themselves.

- Once matured, the flower releases pollen that is cycled through the respiratory system and expelled into the air from the mouth.
###### Overgrowth
- The plant, embedded in the respiratory system, grows as it continues to feed, blocking the airways.
- The plant is small, but prolonged parasitism can cause them to become larger.
- Flowers weak from overgrowing are torn and coughed up.
- The [[Mana#Mana Signature|mana signature]] of the plant becomes detectable to mana-sensitive species.

##### Host Outcome

--- start-multi-column: HostOutcome
```column-settings
border: disabled
shadow: disabled
number of columns: 3
column width: [35%, 35%, 20%%]
```

###### Symptoms
**Early:**
- Sore throat.
- Impaired voice.
- Throat tickle.
- Chest discomfort.

**Advanced:**
- Heightened emotional reactivity, particularly those linked to the *bound emotion*.
- Emotional and physical fatigue.
- Erratic behaviour.
- Tendency to fixate on the *producers* of the *bound emotion*.
 
--- end-column --- 

**In demons:**
- Respiratory symptoms include difficulty breathing, exhaustion and chest pains.
- Feverish symptoms which, combined with emotional outbursts, meet the conditions for [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Outburst Flu|outburst flu]].
- However, a demon's [[Mana#Mana Flow|mana flow]] will naturally react and cut off the *amplifloris* and its interaction with the host's emotions, depriving it off its required nutrients and killing it off.
- For demons, it has a very low fatality rate.

**In humans and non-mana species:**
- Causes [[Hanahaki Disease|hanahaki disease]].
- Coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pains, coughing flower petals.
- Emotional and physical fatigue leading to eventual collapse.
- Unless removed, it is 100% fatal, resulting in suffocation.

##### Countermeasures
- There are only three ways to remove a successfully seeded and growing or flowered *amplifloris.*

```

**Natural occurrence**
- *Only in demons*, as they have an inherent immune system in mana flow that defends against mana-based threats and infections.
- The defensive cells within a demon's mana flow severs the *amplifloris'* connection to the host's emotions, strangling and killing it.
- Like most mana-based entities, the *amplifloris* dissolves into mana upon death, which integrates into the demon's natural mana flow.

**Surgery**
- Precise extraction of the flower.
- Removal often results in _memory loss_ tied to the producers of the tuned emotion.
- The most surefire and successful way to remove the flower.

--- end-column ---

**Ejection / Over-Fertilisation**
- When the *amplifloris* is overfed an *bound emotion* all at once, the flower becomes *overfertilised*.
- Still inside the host's body, the flower is crushed and collapses, unable to sustainably absorb the *bound emotion*.
- Its roots naturally decay, shrivel, and weaken.
- The flower is dislodged from the host's lungs and upchucked by the host.
	- Potential throat damage, but non-permanent and non-fatal.
	- The host may expel petals, leaves, stems, roots, and even blood.
- This method does not cause *memory loss*.
- This method is known to be difficult to achieve, requiring an emotional overwhelm.
