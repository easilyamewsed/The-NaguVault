##### Overview
*Supertype:* Resource | *Subtype:* Natural/Harvestable | *Element:* Typeless
*Armor class:* 13-21 | *Size:* Tiny (2) - Gargantuan (♾) 

- A foundational resource of the [[Worldbuilding/Virtual Universe/Otherworlds/Demon World/Demon World|Demon World]].
- Formed from [[Mana|mana]] that becomes bottlenecked or trapped within stone or coves of stone. When it grows too dense, it begins to saturate the surrounding sediment. The mana [[Mana#Ambient Mana|binds]] to the molecular structure of the stone, creating a crystalline casing. 
- This 'borrowing' of the stone’s makeup allows mana to crystallize, but it also means the geode's stability is tied to the integrity of its stone casing.
- Mana geodes continue to grow as more mana is bottlenecked, constructing more layers over pre-existing ones.
- Since geodes are inorganic, they do not actively consume or generate mana, but serve as reservoirs of stored energy. Mana geodes are prized for their versatility.
- Geodes can be artificially created when a mana-manipulating entity expends their own mana with appropriate conditions. However, this is a taxing process, generally not worth the returns.
- Mana geodes are *extremely common*, but *the higher the grade, the more progressively rare they become.*

###### Aesthetics
- Colour varies with mana density and purity. They may be multi-coloured.
	- The most common colours of mana geodes are red and blue.
- High-purity geodes exhibit luminous and beautiful hues, with undulating or shimmering qualities.
- Low-purity geodes may appear cloudy, or include striations of dark or muted colours.

- Exterior shells are rough and stone-like, concealing the vibrant crystalline structure within.
- Interiors contain sparkling crystals with sharp, angular formations or smooth, reflective surfaces.

###### Details
- Since mana is an ethereal [[Essence|essence]], its crystallised form is *surprisingly light.*
- Even large geodes can be much lighter than they first appear.
- The density of mana can add to the overall weight of a geode, but they remain lighter than typical stones or metals.
- Mana may create veins or fixtures (deposits), where raw mana seeps into rock over time unimpeded, forming crystalline growths directly on surfaces.
	- Cave walls, mountainsides, or underground caverns or tunnels.
	- Often polished by natural processes.
	- Sometimes creates [[Mana Cave|mana caves]].

###### Utility
**Crafting material**
- Integral. A geode cannot be properly used in any manner unless the crystals have been severed or mined from connecting rock.
- Improper severing can lead to contamination.
	- *In people:* resulting in sickness, where any mana drawn from a geode risks disrupting [[Mana#Mana Flow|mana flow]] as the mana is still bound to stone.
	- *In objects:* where the geode can 'leak', making it less effective or unusable.
		- Impure crystals have diminished or erratic output.
		- Particularly dense geodes may burst or explode.
	- They must be refined into [[Mana Cache|mana caches]] before they can be used.
		- Refinement involves isolating mana from its borrowed stone elements, purging impurities, and stabilisation for long-term use.
		- This ensures mana can flow freely within containment, without risks in usage.

**Environment**
- When planted in mana-depleted soils, the energy within geodes can revitalize ecosystems.
	- However, ecosystems oversaturated with mana may give birth to [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Lesser Demons|lesser demons]].

###### Economy
- While raw geodes are common, their utility relies on skilled refinement, making miners and refiners valued professions. 
- Everything about the Demon World is powered by mana, meaning the vast majority of demons– especially commoners– are either miners or militia.
- Their abundance is balanced by the requirements to utilise them.
- Their abundance also makes illegal refinement very common, resulting in a lot of *impure and unsafe mana caches*, especially in the [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Red Market|Red Market]].

**Currency**
- Though practically unusable, their value is ubiquitous for their potential when refined.
- Nearly all aspects of demon society, including lifestyle and combat.
- Their abundance ensures they are accessible to all, but the value lies in refinement and skilled use.
- Miners and refiners of mana geodes are paid by the [[Royal House]] in shelter, amenities, allowances, nutrition, etc.
