##### Overview
*Supertype:* Resource | *Subtype:* Ethereal | *Element:* Typeless

- A fundamental resource innate to demons and other creatures of the [[Worldbuilding/Virtual Universe/Otherworlds/Demon World/Demon World|Demon World]].
- The relationship between *innate mana* (within organisms) and *ambient mana* (in the environment) mirrors that of magma and lava—connected but distinct in function.
- Demons routinely replenish and expel mana to sustain life and prevent [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Mana Combustion|mana combustion]]. This aligns with their combative nature, as battle provides a natural outlet for mana release.
- Mana can be recovered *over time* and through other *nutritional means*.

###### Innate Mana
- Mana contained within a demon’s body, serving as a vital life resource akin to blood.
- Stored in what is known as [[Mana#Mana Recesses|mana recesses]] and circulated through [[Mana#Mana Flow|mana flow]].
	- Deeper mana recesses and greater reserves are often inherited traits, tied to the inherent strength of a demon's lineage.
- Enables magic and other abilities unique to demons.
- Participates in [[Mana#Mana Flow|regenerative processes]] and overall vitality.
- Mana is a key component in the creation and birth of new demons, shaping their inherent traits and abilities.

###### Ambient Mana
- Naturally occurring mana that suffuses the world, abundant and omnipresent like air.
- Demons absorb ambient mana passively, akin to breathing oxygen.
- Mana may manifest as [[Mana Geode|mana geode]], which contain mana that can only be used and not absorbed.
	- These are often turned into [[Mana Cache|mana caches]], or exchanged as currency amongst low-ranking demons (as high-ranking demons wouldn't need them, already inherently retaining deep mana recesses).
- High concentrations of ambient mana can coalesce into living beings or phenomena, creating:
	- Monstrous, plant-like, or animalistic entities.
	- Natural disasters like [[Manastorm|manastorms]] or mana-based auroras.
- Some worlds are more mana-saturated than others, affecting the abundance of ambient mana.

##### Mana Flow
- A circulatory system unique to creatures of the Demon World, allowing for the storage, manipulation, and interaction with mana.
- Functions like a vascular system but is not physically visible.
- Contains "carrier cells" for resource distribution, "defensive cells" to combat mana-based threats, and "regenerative cells" for the reparation of injuries.
	- Conducts *regenerative processes* and serves as a defensive mechanism.
- Ensures excess mana is expelled, preventing dangerous build-ups.

##### Mana Recesses
- Storage spaces within demons and other creatures that house mana reserves.
- Largely hereditary, but trainable to an extent.
- Pores in the body absorb mana into these recesses.
- Capacity determines how much mana can be stored without causing [[Loose Leaf/Prev. Versions/Demon World#Mana Combustion|combustion]].

###### Mana Signature
- A unique identifier tied to a creature’s mana, akin to a fingerprint.
- Mana-sensitive species may be able to sense or track mana signatures.
###### Emotional Currents
- Fluctuations in mana flow tied to heightened emotional states.
- Can amplify or distort supernatural effects.

###### Mana Binding
- The process by which mana attaches to or integrates with objects, entities, or environments.
- Allows mana to interact, influence, or synchronize with the target's structure or essence, facilitating energy exchange or stabilization.
- **Natural Binding**
	- Where the mana 'borrows' properties from its surroundings to inform its own structure.
	- Only occurs when mana is highly dense, highly concentrated, and highly contained.
- **Organic Binding**
	- Mana is bound to the host's mana signature, forming a synchronized connection.
	- The binding enables dynamic energy transfer, allowing mana-based flora or fauna to draw nutrients or manipulate emotional currents.
- **Artificial Binding**
	- Also known as *enchanting.*
	- Demons and other mana-sensitive beings can intentionally bind mana to objects or entities.
