### Overview 
- Languages spoken by the sapient creatures of the sea. 
- These languages are old, and less prone to change than usual languages.

---
#### Common Pelagic 

- The most used language by the sea's sapient beings.
- Due to the way sounds carry underwater, the vocal cords of seafolk are used differently: utilising clicks, whistles, hums, occasionally underlaid with lung tones.
- Not at all dissimilar to dolphins.
- Used for social coordination, hunting, navigation, etcetera.
- To outsiders, it sounds alive, and even playful. 

##### Origins & Development 

- A language developed alongside the natural evolution of the seafolk.
- Through liaison with humans, it has, over time, developed cadences particular to the use of lungs.
- The integration of human language has lent to vocabulary expansion over centuries, accommodating growing but scattered populations and lending to complex sequences of clicks and whistles.
- Due to human language (referred to often by seafolk as *'lung-speech'*) not carrying well underwater, it is only used for close-proximity communication.
	- Meaning that—in the sea—the use of human language between seafolk is incredibly intimate.
- The scattered seafolk populations—ranging from tropical-adjacent to deeper-sea—has created a number of dialects in the pelagic language.

- The written language is formed primarily of harsh and sharp strokes, likely due to having to be carved into stone.

##### Cultural Context
- The use of this language by humans and non-seafolk indicates a scholarly background, or a trade that heavily involves interaction with the seafolk.
	- That being said, traffickers are usually ignorant of this language altogether.
	- It is known that, if a seafolk speaks human, they have a higher chance of escaping traffickers. 
- It is impossible for common pelagic to mimic song, and the [[Merfolk|mers]] in particular find music discomforting, due to the stigmas surrounding [[Sirens|sirens]], which they are often mistaken for.
	- Despite this, the introduction of human music to the [[Merfolk|merfolk]] was revolutionary.

###### Function & Role 
- Essentially an everyday language of the seafolk. 
- It is used most liberally in hunting, but is also the primary means of communication, courting, and all other things required of language by societies.

###### Speakers
- [[Merfolk]]
- [[Sirens]]
- Other creatures of the sea.

#### Deep Pelagic (Sirenic)

###### About 
- A language only used by the children of the [[Old Ones]].
- Alike to whale-song—but not merely whale-song. A linguistic echo of the [[Old Ones|Old Ones']] resonant code.
- Where the [[Old Ones]] do not speak—instead vibrating reality through patterned frequencies—deep pelagic is a biological imitation of that principle, made possible by resonant chambers in the skull and thorax.
- When vocalised in air of shallow water, it bears the following qualities:
	- Multi-tone chords; two or three frequencies per individual
	- Subharmonic, producing unease or obsession
	- Sustained vowels with no obvious breaks; sentences seem like single, living notes 
	- Overtone glides that shift meaning; a change in interval alters the whole phrase 
- Mesmerising, but alien—the ocean speaking back.
- An intensely enamouring, enigmatic, and ethereal language.
- It resonates most loudly underwater.

##### Origins & Development  

- Said to be the favoured children of the [[Old Ones]], the [[Sirens||sirens]] are the sole sapient listeners of their voices. 
- They put their gifts to work in the mimicry of the [[Old Ones|Old Ones']] voices, and translate them in the sounds that create deep pelagic.
- It is an intensely personal language, with no written record and reliant entirely on interpretation. But it is understood by all creatures of the sea on an instinctual level that cannot be described.
	- In the way one knows a storm is coming, or knows the smell of rain, or feels a tremor beneath their feet.
	- In this sense, it can be considered a primordial language. 

- It can only be studied by other species in the form of the written language known as *Aklo*.
	- *Aklo* was posed by a human scholar of unknown origins. He was known to be an eccentric man with blue hair.
- Though it should be noted that the [[Sirens|sirens]] themselves have no written version of this language.

##### Cultural Context 
- As the only speakers of this language, [[Sirens|sirens]] are heavily regarded as threats to all species within the sea.
- This language—in combination with the mesmorising vocal capabilities bestowed upon them—is capable of casting a thrall upon all who hear, depending on the incantation.
- It is also known for its effect on sea entities said to be children of the [[Old Ones]], commanding or quelling creatures like [[Krakens|krakens]].
- It has been utilised liberally for malicious purposes, and has created a stereotype surrounding the dangers of [[Sirens|sirens]].
- As such, users of this language are feared as much as they are alluring.
- *Deep pelagic*—or *sirenic*—was utilised heavily in the rituals by the townspeople of [[Old Ones' Pulpit|Vervena]].
- It is also used by sirens in courting rituals.

######  Function & Role 
- A ritual language above all else, not used for common communication.
- Malicious users can utilise it both in the sea and above it, to charm others into obsession, self-destruction, or eventual insanity.
- It is a beautiful language that can be used to rouse or quell creatures of the deep, or other children of the [[Old Ones]].

###### Speakers 
- [[Sirens]]
