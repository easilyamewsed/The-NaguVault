#Looseleaf

It starts with boredom—no, actually, it starts with Hibari looking for snacks in the shared dressing room, shoving aside three different bags that all have Kanato’s initials scribbled on the lining (possessive, much?). Then he looks up, mid-crinkle of a seaweed packet, and finds Kanato at the end of the table, sleeves rolled, hair a little mussed, mouth in that very serious mafia-boy straight line that says, _Don’t talk to me, I’m doing crime-adjacent things._

Hibari hovers, because Kanato, against all sense and laws of common decency, is taking apart a handgun. Not even a scary one—just a sleek, businesslike little thing, matte and stainless, and Hibari realizes he has no idea where it even _came from._ Mafia privilege? Mafia vending machine? Mafia care package from his weird cousin with the skirts?

Kanato’s hands are deft. That’s what hits first. Not big or rough or callused like you’d expect—no, his fingers are elegant, precise, nails trimmed short, every motion so deliberate it’s almost rehearsed. Slide, click, twist, part comes away. It’s not even loud; it’s a quiet violence. Metal kissing metal, a little sigh of a spring, the roll of his thumb over the grip like he’s petting a cat.

Hibari thinks he should say something. Like: “Hey, what’s the gun for?” or “You know there’s literally a camera in here?” or maybe “Can you please stop making weaponry look like a magic trick, some of us are trying to not be criminals this week?”

But all that comes out is an undignified squeak as Kanato pops the barrel loose, his eyes flicking up, just for a second. Those eyes—blue as bad intentions, purple if you catch them in the right light, sharp enough to make Hibari’s pulse trip over itself.

“You good?” Kanato deadpans, and Hibari, in his infinite wisdom, nearly chokes on seaweed.

Kanato keeps going, completely unbothered, assembling and disassembling with the efficiency of a guy who probably used to practice this in his dad’s study, because his bedtime stories were cautionary tales about not leaving fingerprints. He looks good like this. Way too good. The shirt sleeves ride up his forearms, and there’s a faint scar over one wrist, and for a hot, inconvenient second Hibari wants to grab him by the elbow and ask, “Show me how?” But that would require basic self-preservation, which Hibari does not have.

He’s not even sure _why_ it’s sexy. It just _is_. Maybe it’s the focus, or the casual ownership of something so dangerous, or the little half-smirk Kanato gets when he lines up every piece, reassembles the gun with a cocky click and a flourish like a stage magician, then sets it aside like it’s nothing at all. Like, “Oh, this? Just a part of my day. Like brushing my teeth. Or, you know, murder.”

Kanato wipes his hands on a cloth, tosses a look Hibari’s way that feels loaded. “You want something?”

Hibari’s brain fizzles. He blurts, “Uh—seaweed?” and offers the packet, which is possibly the least threatening move in the room. Kanato blinks, shrugs, and takes it, biting down with an offhand grace that somehow makes _seaweed_ look illicit.

Later, Hibari will forget how to sleep. He’ll remember Kanato’s hands, the way they moved, the confidence, the coolness, the stupidly hot mafia efficiency of it all. He’ll keep that vision tucked somewhere behind his eyes, for days, weeks, maybe forever, and never say a word. Not until he figures out why just _watching_ Kanato break down a gun made him feel like _he_ was the one falling to pieces.
