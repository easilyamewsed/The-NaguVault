<blockquote>
<p>I had known little of the Demon World– which, in my encounters with various inhabitants, I had surmised to be different to the Demon World of Helesta, or Hell. I had been sheltering from a storm in an alcove at the base of a mountain– an alcove that I found to be rather deep. It is in my nature as an explorer to investigate, and so off I went. And the cave went on and on, until I found myself unable to turn back. The way had disappeared.</p>
<p>I understand my lifestyle is very unappealing to most, and I truly had felt no remorse in it until I was met with the unrelenting blackness spread before me. Perpetual, unending. I cannot guess as to the Demon World’s larger purpose in the scope of the Virtual Universe, but it is an inherently unkind, inhospitable land. Roamed by unholy, monstrous creatures of loping shapes… and odd ones, too, if my eyes did not deceive me. In old legends, they are claimed to be guards, and I wonder if this realm is the originator of the Japanese tales of “Yomi”. But I argue there is nothing to guard but wastelands and mountains. The demons I had met– the ones who made no attempts on my life– had never spoken of how vast their motherland was, and I found myself lucky that the slip in the network was close to the nexus city.</p>
<p>I was picked up at the edge of the border by a group of civilian patrolmen, who seemed fittingly surprised at my survival in-so-far. Though I dwelt there for a number of days, I never once heard a name for the metropolis the demons inhabit, but it is simultaneously medieval and modern. For instance, the castle looked as if ripped straight from gothic fantasy. But the outer districts, where I spent most of my time, reminded me more of the suburban housing of my own town far, far away.&lt;/</p>
<p>With fortune, I eventually returned to my origin lands– apparently, it is not impossible for mortals to slip through the cracks. I was not the first and would not be the last. In the past, it would not have been possible for me to have survive walking those streets. Even then, I felt hungry eyes upon me. Somehow, these creatures make their living here… I do not think they are aware of how fractious and disorderly their way of life is. But if there is more to be said, it is that– in some strange way– their endless realm meshes liminality with naturality. I felt as if I was passing, not beyond or below, just through. And, might I be called odd in sense, I felt rather at peace.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The Demon World’s Sole City</strong></em></p>
<p>“Rising from the endless, dark plain, the Demon World– that is, the city– rests upon a solitary hill. It is not difficult to see, with its towers and castle glowing with mana geodes. The concentric rings of the city spiral outward from the castle, and the land stretches flat in every direction. Unbroken and bleak, and yet the demons have no more defense than some paltry walls. I wonder if their arrogance is reflected in the placement of their settlement, as they are vulnerable to the open air and whims of the land pressing against them. The wilderness beyond seemed eager to claim what they so boldly showcased, but I believe this what the demons intend– taking their dominion over a world that seems ready to consume them. Pride, it seems, is both their strength and their folly.</p>
<p>There are spats of geysers leading toward it, which I imagine, are part of the water system they seem to have mastered. I remember seeing a network of rivers, dredged from and disappearing into the ground. I suspect they rely on subterranean water. In my very short stay, I learnt that mana flows well with water, as it does with blood. Perhaps it is something similar to the way oxygen dissolves in water, and this may be why the city has terraformed its system– to safely expel the concentrations of mana that tend to accumulate. From what I gathered, keeping high amounts of mana in one space for too long is incredibly dangerous. Given how compact the city is, and that it is inhabited by a race that both absorbs and exudes it, I loathe to imagine the possibilities.</p>
<p>There is a beauty in the balance they maintain, though I cannot help but see it as precarious. But, perhaps it is not their character to bend knee to nature.”</p>

<p>In the Demon World, <em>strength is not only a virtue but a necessity</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>A Peculiar Blend of Fantasy &amp; Mundane</strong></em></p>
<p>“I had only known of Castle Tenbrelith through my excessive studies of otherworlds. It is to my understanding that demons do not refer to the castle by any name at all, but it exists in records nonetheless. I imagine humanity could only bear so much of the demon race’s vague naming schemes, and simply made one for them. In my transmundology classes, it was often a topic of contention to the point where the very concept of the castle itself began to seem comical.</p>
<p>I was wholly unprepared for the castle’s otherworldly majesty. It is well-known the Demon World’s main trade is in metals, ores, and weapons, but to see the very path leading to it laden with flecks of gold and ruby… the wealth is beyond my comprehension. It is no wonder that the god of the underworld is also known as the god of riches in Greek mythos. Its arches, windows, what-have-you, were laced with mana geodes, lending it a faint glow.</p>
<p>What struck me most, however, was the stark contrast between this ancient edifice and the outer rings of the city. The circles that radiate outward from the castle grow progressively modern, culminating in structures reminiscent of Japanese family homes. I understand the Demon World has held a particular fondness for Japan since the Demon-Human Interworld War, but I found this almost amusing.</p>
<p>This dissonance seemed almost intentional, as though the Demon World’s metropolis sought to mirror both its storied past and its strange kinship with humanity’s modernity.”</p>

<p><em><strong>A High House Lord, Merely a Boy</strong></em></p>
<p>“During my unplanned stay, I encountered a young man in noble garb, his demeanor surprisingly approachable for a demon of his rank. He offered me a mana cache in exchange for the strawberries I had stashed in my pack. I gave them to him for free, as I cannot use a mana cache. He was delighted by the fact the gift was free. I asked if there was some form of ritual involved, but he merely said it was ‘no big deal, he just really likes strawberries’, popped one in his mouth, and sauntered off. At the time, I thought him no more than a wealthy eccentric with a good sense of smell.</p>
<p>A bystander froze mid-step, their eyes wide with shock, before cautiously approaching me and whispering in hushed tones. Only then did I learn I had spoken to Commander Aleksandre Lagusa, Lord of the most influential High House! Renowned for his cunning in battle and critical role during the Demon-Human Interworld War, I was flabbergasted. For what purpose was the Demon King’s Watchdog gallivanting about in the outer rings? That such a notorious figure would bargain for strawberries… I will surely remember it for the rest of my days.</p>
<p>I could not help but be jealous of his youth, despite his minimum sixty years of life. And I had to wonder– it was thanks to that boy that peace was achieved between the human and demon realms. But looking so young, I was struck by the fact he surely could not have done it alone. If I recall, there are faint records of a human soldier, whose name is lost to time. That human was shunned for treason and executed, though we are not taught why his death brought an end to the war.</p>
<p>Recalling Lord Lagusa, I cannot help think of that nameless young man.”</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>“Strength is virtue.”</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Strength is the axis upon which all morality turns.</em></li>
<li>Strength is not merely physical or magical power but also encompasses wit, cunning, and resilience.</li>
<li>The weak have value only in their ability to serve or better themselves under the tutelage of the strong. Protecting subordinates is seen as both a burden and a mark of power.</li>
<li>The strong lead because they prove themselves capable of withstanding and conquering challenges. Leadership is earned.
<ul>
<li>Masters or nobles who fail to protect their subordinates are seen as unworthy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strength by inherited traits is seen as fortune, something that is begrudged, but respected.</li>
<li>Fights for dominance are viewed as natural and necessary; the cutthroat nature of the Demon World can only be handled by the best.</li>
<li>This philosophy creates a society where mentorship and rivalry coexist, forming a volatile balance between cooperation and individualism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“Power is absolute.”</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Power is the absolute authority. Those who are in authority belong there.</em></li>
<li>Those who know they are weaker must know their place and defer.</li>
<li>Authority stems from might, and challenges to authority are viewed as a natural part of societal function.</li>
<li>The weak may rise in proving themselves, and the strong must constantly defend their position.</li>
<li>This fosters a ‘never rest’ mentality, where complacency is therefore considered the greatest sin.
<ul>
<li>The “never rest” mentality extends beyond combat into intellectual and magical pursuits.</li>
<li>Mana mastery is seen as an ongoing responsibility to oneself and one’s place in the hierarchy.</li>
<li>Failure to innovate or improve oneself risks one’s position in the hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Succession in noble houses is determined by combat and displays of strength.</li>
<li>A challenge must never be refused, lest you be seen as weak or unfit.</li>
<li>Even the royal family is constantly scrutinised, and challenged to prove they deserve their authority.</li>
<li>“Stagnation is death” is a common saying tied to this principle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“Mana, the Lifeblood.”</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Mana is sacred, representing both a personal and universal life force.</em>
<ul>
<li>It is a privilege, not a right, to wield mana.</li>
<li>Misuse or neglect of mana is viewed as moral failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mana is the essence of existence, and must be granted the utmost respect.</li>
<li>Mana flows through all things, and its dispersal upon death into the atmosphere ties into reincarnation beliefs.</li>
<li>Rituals or practices exist to honour mana’s return to the Demon World upon one’s death.</li>
<li>Philosophical debates might revolve around whether mana is something demons own or something they borrow and must repay.</li>
<li>Demons do not interfere with natural disasters caused by mana, nor do they seek to over-industrialise it.</li>
<li>Many demons understand mana to be a gift, granted to them to make them higher beings.
<ul>
<li>This point is double-sided. It causes superiority complexes and discrimination, but humbles demons in the use of their ‘gift’.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Eternalism</strong>
<ul>
<li>The philosophy that <em>existence is eternal.</em></li>
<li>The infinite nature of the Demon World reflects the belief in an unbroken cycle of existence.</li>
<li>The wastelands and endless underground caverns symbolize eternal life and death as part of the same continuum.</li>
<li>Demons see themselves as pieces of an eternal network: <em>they are born of mana, live to use it, and return it upon death</em>.</li>
<li>Their immortality is not absolute, and many die early deaths in the Demon World. <em>When demons die, they dissolve into ash, and their mana is dispersed into the atmosphere.</em></li>
<li>Reincarnation is not romanticized; it is viewed pragmatically as a simple truth.</li>
<li>Fosters a deep sense of fatalism in many demons.</li>
<li>For others, this fosters apathy or despair, especially in those with <em>lower destructive drives</em>, resulting in mental illnesses like depression or susceptibility to <a href="../../../Loose-Leaf/Prev.-Versions/Demon-World#outburst-flu" class="internal alias" data-slug="Loose-Leaf/Prev.-Versions/Demon-World">outburst flu</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“Pride is identity.”</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Pride is the cornerstone of a demon’s identity and actions.</em></li>
<li>Demons must never diminish themselves or allow their reputation to falter.</li>
<li>Insults and defeats are viewed as assaults on one’s very existence.</li>
<li>Pride is not blind arrogance but a commitment to defending one’s worth and contributions.
<ul>
<li>Acts of humility are understood as weakness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creative pursuits, such as art or battle, are seen as extensions of one’s pride and individuality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“Accept no slight.”</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Insults or betrayals must be addressed, as unresolved grievances tarnish one’s honour.</em></li>
<li>Challenges, revenge, manipulation, coercion, seduction, threats, blackmail and blood feuds are all valid ways to settle disputes and disagreements.</li>
<li>The longer a slight festers without resolution, the greater the loss of respect from one’s peers.
<ul>
<li>As such, communication is very straight-forward in the Demon World.</li>
<li>This may alternatively lead to demon’s being cagey about their thoughts and/or emotions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“Destruction, an art.”</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Violence and destruction are not viewed as senseless acts but as expressions of creativity and dominance.</em></li>
<li>Battle is a performance; the victor demonstrates superiority not just in strength but also in technique and artistry.</li>
<li>Demons also believe destruction to be part of the eternal cycle– strongly represented by their constant defense against lessers and ferals at the walls.</li>
<li>Architecture in the Demon World reflects this philosophy, often blending brutal functionality with aesthetic beauty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“Death is destruction.”</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Death is not viewed as an end but as a violent return to mana’s eternal cycle.</em></li>
<li>The act of death—be it battle, execution, or decay—is considered the ultimate form of destruction, and destruction is seen as release, then creation in reincarnation.</li>
<li>To die without leaving an impression (whether through battle, art, or legacy) is viewed as a failure.</li>
<li>The ashes of the dead, rich with dispersed mana, are often revered. They are sometimes collected and used in rituals to strengthen mana reserves or to fertilize mana-infused soil for symbolic renewal.</li>
<li>This philosophy fosters a disdain for passive deaths or those that lack impact, creating a cultural obsession with “worthy ends.”</li>
<li>Cowardice in death or intentional loss is considered a disgrace and moral failure.</li>
<li>While demons believe in reincarnation, this does not diminish their respect for the finality and transformative power of destruction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>“Weakness is your own.”</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Demons who fail to survive or ascend have only themselves to blame.</em></li>
<li>Suffering is a private matter, and failure is rarely pitied.</li>
<li>Public displays of helplessness are deeply shameful, though the strong may offer aid to prove their superiority.</li>
<li>This philosophy is harsher but widely respected in lower ranks.</li>
<li>This philosophy is precarious for higher ranks, where pride often outweighs the cost of surviving a failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchal harmony</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>The societal hierarchy is not a rigid caste but a dynamic system where strength, intelligence, and cunning dictate one’s place.</em></li>
<li>Respect flows upward, but protection flows downward.</li>
<li>While weaker demons serve their superiors, they do so in exchange for security and resources.</li>
<li>Conflicts within the hierarchy are expected, but chaos is despised.
<ul>
<li>Challenges can be issued to whomever, by whomever, wherever, but challenges and personal vendettas should not disrupt societal function.</li>
<li>Otherwise, <em>exile is swift and unrelenting.</em></li>

<li>Ashes of the deceased are scattered into the air.</li>
<li>These ceremonies are quiet, and the attendance of nobles in their best attire is a symbol of recognition for the deceased.</li>

<ul>
<li>Ritual combat is used to resolve disputes and prove worth.</li>
<li>Challenges made ad repente often command a large street audience.</li>
<li>Challenges to nobles, especially High Houses and the Royal House, are more formal, and always take place in <strong>Area 6</strong> to prevent city damage from high mana output.</li>
<li><em>Proof of valour or strength is required to challenge the High Houses or Royal Family,</em> but members of the High House may accept informal challenges if approached directly.</li>
<li>Challenges are not always safe, but death in challenge is seen as a high honour.</li>

<ul>
<li>A traditional rite to inaugurate new lords and ladies of the High Houses.</li>
<li>To earn their title, they must pilgrimage to large and ancient mana wells, geode pockets, or other natural wonders of the Demon World, which produce only the most lustrous of mana ores.</li>
<li>They must return with a lustrous geode that will embellish their weapon of choice, a gift from the King.</li>
<li>A ceremony will then be held to take their oath, reciting the Ten Virtues. They are then officially granted their weapon and named Lord or Lady.</li>
<li>There has been no handover of the royal crown in centuries, so the ritual involved in the inauguration of the royal family has somewhat faded into obscurity.</li>

<ul>
<li>On the birthdays of Lords, Ladies, and acting members of the royal family, they are open to receiving <em>challenges from anyone, even children.</em></li>

<li><em>Challenges can be made for any purpose</em>– to absolve a crime, or as a challenge for authority, succession, possession, debt, etcetera. They can even be made on grounds of death.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>On Question of Laws in the Demon World</strong></em></p>
<p>“For my brief time in the otherworld, I am often asked if demons are as unruly and violent as they seem. It is a difficult question to answer, because many of them appear rather civil. t is a challenging question to answer, for while they often appear quite civil, their world operates on rules unlike any other. From what I observed, many demons have little time interest in entertaining humans as no more than a resource or novelty. Their lives are consumed by a relentless drive to prove themselves. My tour guide was the patrolman who had found me after I slipped through the network. I was bound for Area 4, in need of transportation back to the human realm, and what I found there was as interesting as it was stomach-churning.</p>
<p>At one point, we passed a covered cart trundling down the street. The faint, metallic tang in the air was unmistakable, even to me. My pulse quickened as a dreadful possibility came to mind, though the patrolman beside me showed no sign of concern. I hesitated, my gaze lingering on the cart as it turned down the gold-flecked road.
The patrolman beside me, catching my gaze, smirked. ‘Don’t stare too hard,’ he said lightly. ‘You might end up in there yourself.’
Horrified, or morbidly intrigued, I queried, tentatively, the contents.
He chuckled. Chilling. ‘Just cargo, nothing you’d want to be part of.’ When he saw my pallor, he slapped my shoulder warmly, ‘Relax. You’re with me, aren’t you?’
Unable to suppress my unease, I carefully asked about laws in the Demon World.
‘Laws?’ he repeated, tone laced with amusement, ‘Like rules? Yeah, we’ve got those, I guess. But it’s mostly just stuff nobody cares about. Unless you’re talking about the Ten Virtues, those are different. But  it’s not like the bigwigs are around to enforce anything these days… and there’s no point stopping them. If they’re weak enough to get caught, that’s their problem. And if the nobles aren’t diligent enough to catch them, then, well. That’s theirs.’</p>
<p>He dismissed me like water off metal, leaving me to wrestle my own thoughts.
I couldn’t believe his nonchalance, but I was more so shocked by the absolute obviousness of the cart’s conduct. I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised by the demon race’s ubiquitous opinion of illegal activities– I believe this is another symptom of the race’s inherent arrogance. To disguise an act is to admit weakness, and in this world, the strong have no reason to hide. The weak lose to the strong, and so the strong cannot be apprehended by the weak.</p>
<p>As we walked on, I could not shake the dissonance. Bonds here were forged not in kindness but in survival, some form of double-standard rivalry. A paradoxical society that thrived on hierarchal unity and yet ruthless individualism. It was both awe-inspiring and deeply unsettling, and what disturbed me most was my capacity to so easily understand it.”</p>

<ul>
<li>The Demon World takes little mercy, but in exchange, suffers an inability to address prominent crime.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Public Exile</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most feared punishments, exile involves being cast out into <strong>Area 7</strong> or beyond.</li>
<li>It is not feared for its brutality, but rather the aspect of public humiliation.</li>
<li>Exiled demons publicly have their <em>wings clipped</em> and <em>mana recesses sealed</em> before being thrown out of the city.</li>
<li>Only the thrifty can truly survive, doomed to turn feral.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Public Execution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Used for treason, rebellion, or crimes against the crown.</li>
<li>Executions are ceremonial, with the offender’s mana dispersal symbolizing their return to the Demon World.</li>
<li>Spectators view these events as both a warning and spectacle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trial by Combat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reserved for disputes or challenges to authority, where strength determines justice.</li>
<li>Criminals may also propose trial by combat to escape sentencing, at the cost of a <em>greater sentence should they lose.</em>
<ul>
<li>As such, criminals are allowed to <em>choose their opponents from a selection of High House representatives.</em> Cheating is seen as a viable strategy.</li>
<li>Some crimes are orchestrated purely to grant challenge rights against the High Houses, which are normally unobtainable for lower-ranking demons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combat is to the death or until surrender, with the victor’s claim upheld.</li>
<li>Death during a combat trial is seen as an honourable resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mana Sealing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For crimes involving mana misuse or illegal mana practices, the offender’s mana recesses are sealed, rendering them powerless.</li>
<li>Often used as a precursor to exile or servitude, as mana-sealed demons cannot defend themselves effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Forced Labour</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Common punishment for resource-related crimes.</li>
<li>Offenders are sent to the mines of <strong>Area 6</strong>, where they extract mana geodes under harsh conditions.</li>
</ul>
